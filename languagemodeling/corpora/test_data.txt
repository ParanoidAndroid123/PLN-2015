When there is such disorder in my wit .
O Lord , my boy , my Arthur , my fair son !
My life , my joy , my food , my all the world !
My widow-comfort , and my sorrows' cure !


I fear some outrage , and I'll follow her .


There's nothing in this world can make me joy :
Life is as tedious as a twice-told tale ,
Vexing the dull ear of a drowsy man ;
And bitter shame hath spoil'd the sweet world's taste ,
That it yields nought but shame and bitterness .

Before the curing of a strong disease ,
Even in the instant of repair and health ,
The fit is strongest : evils that take leave ,
On their departure most of all show evil .
What have you lost by losing of this day ?

All days of glory , joy , and happiness .

If you had won it , certainly you had .
No , no ; when Fortune means to men most good ,
She looks upon them with a threatening eye .
'Tis strange to think how much King John hath lost 
In this which he accounts so clearly won .
Are not you griev'd that Arthur is his prisoner ?

As heartily as he is glad he hath him .

Your mind is all as youthful as your blood .
Now hear me speak with a prophetic spirit ;
For even the breath of what I mean to speak 
Shall blow each dust , each straw , each little rub ,
Out of the path which shall directly lead 
Thy foot to England's throne ; and therefore mark .
John hath seiz'd Arthur ; and it cannot be ,
That whiles warm life plays in that infant's veins 
The misplac'd John should entertain an hour ,
One minute , nay , one quiet breath of rest .
A sceptre snatch'd with an unruly hand 
Must be as boisterously maintain'd as gain'd ;
And he that stands upon a slippery place 
Makes nice of no vile hold to stay him up :
That John may stand , then Arthur needs must fall ;
So be it , for it cannot be but so .

But what shall I gain by young Arthur's fall ?

You , in the right of Lady Blanch your wife ,
May then make all the claim that Arthur did .

And lose it , life and all , as Arthur did .

How green you are and fresh in this old world !
John lays you plots ; the times conspire with you ;
For he that steeps his safety in true blood 
Shall find but bloody safety and untrue .
This act so evilly borne shall cool the hearts 
Of all his people and freeze up their zeal ,
That none so small advantage shall step forth 
To check his reign , but they will cherish it ;
No natural exhalation in the sky ,
No scope of nature , no distemper'd day ,
No common wind , no customed event ,
But they will pluck away his natural cause 
And call them meteors , prodigies , and signs ,
Abortives , presages , and tongues of heaven ,
Plainly denouncing vengeance upon John .

May be he will not touch young Arthur's life ,
But hold himself safe in his prisonment .

O , sir , when he shall hear of your approach ,
If that young Arthur be not gone already ,
Even at that news he dies ; and then the hearts 
Of all his people shall revolt from him 
And kiss the lips of unacquainted change ,
And pick strong matter of revolt and wrath 
Out of the bloody fingers' ends of John .
Methinks I see this hurly all on foot :
And , O , what better matter breeds for you 
Than I have nam'd . The bastard Faulconbridge 
Is now in England ransacking the church ,
Offending charity : if but a dozen French 
Were there in arms , they would be as a call 
To train ten thousand English to their side ;
Or as a little snow , tumbled about ,
Anon becomes a mountain . O noble Dauphin !
Go with me to the king . 'Tis wonderful 
What may be wrought out of their discontent 
Now that their souls are topful of offence .
For England go ; I will whet on the king .

Strong reasons make strong actions . Let us go :
If you say ay , the king will not say no .

Heat me these irons hot ; and look thou stand 
Within the arras : when I strike my foot 
Upon the bosom of the ground , rush forth ,
And bind the boy which you shall find with me 
Fast to the chair : be heedful . Hence , and watch .

I hope your warrant will bear out the deed .

Uncleanly scruples , fear not you : look to't .

Young lad , come forth ; I have to say with you .


Good morrow , Hubert .

Good morrow , little prince .

As little prince ,having so great a title 
To be more prince ,as may be . You are sad .

Indeed , I have been merrier .

Mercy on me !
Methinks nobody should be sad but I :
Yet I remember , when I was in France ,
Young gentlemen would be as sad as night ,
Only for wantonness . By my christendom ,
So I were out of prison and kept sheep ,
I should be as merry as the day is long ;
And so I would be here , but that I doubt 
My uncle practises more harm to me :
He is afraid of me , and I of him .
Is it my fault that I was Geffrey's son ?
No , indeed , is't not ; and I would to heaven 
I were your son , so you would love me , Hubert .

If I talk to him with his innocent prate 
He will awake my mercy which lies dead :
Therefore I will be sudden and dispatch .

Are you sick , Hubert , you look pale to-day :
In sooth , I would you were a little sick ,
That I might sit all night and watch with you :
I warrant I love you more than you do me .

His words do take possession of my bosom .
Read here , young Arthur .

How now , foolish rheum !
Turning dispiteous torture out of door !
I must be brief , lest resolution drop 
Out at mine eyes in tender womanish tears .
Can you not read it , is it not fair writ ?

Too fairly , Hubert , for so foul effect .
Must you with hot irons burn out both mine eyes ?

Young boy , I must .

And will you ?

And I will .

Have you the heart , When your head did but ache ,
I knit my handkercher about your brows ,
The best I had , a princess wrought it me ,
And I did never ask it you again ;
And with my hand at midnight held your head ,
And like the watchful minutes to the hour ,
Still and anon cheer'd up the heavy time ,
Saying , 'What lack you ?' and , 'Where lies your grief ?' 
Or , 'What good love may I perform for you ?' 
Many a poor man's son would have lain still ,
And ne'er have spoke a loving word to you ;
But you at your sick-service had a prince .
Nay , you may think my love was crafty love ,
And call it cunning : do an if you will .
If heaven be pleas'd that you must use me ill ,
Why then you must . Will you put out mine eyes ?
These eyes that never did nor never shall 
So much as frown on you ?

I have sworn to do it ;
And with hot irons must I burn them out .

Ah , none but in this iron age would do it !
The iron of itself , though heat red-hot ,
Approaching near these eyes , would drink my tears 
And quench this fiery indignation 
Even in the matter of mine innocence ;
Nay , after that , consume away in rust ,
But for containing fire to harm mine eye .
Are you more stubborn-hard than hammer'd iron ?
An if an angel should have come to me 
And told me Hubert should put out mine eyes ,
I would not have believ'd him ; no tongue but Hubert's .

Come forth .

Do as I bid you do .

O , save me , Hubert , save me , my eyes are out 
Even with the fierce looks of these bloody men .

Give me the iron , I say , and bind him here .

Alas , what need you be so boisterousrough ?
I will not struggle ; I will stand stone-still .
For heaven's sake , Hubert , let me not be bound !
Nay , hear me , Hubert : drive these men away ,
And I will sit as quiet as a lamb ;
I will not stir , nor wince , nor speak a word ,
Nor look upon the iron angerly .
Thrust but these men away , and I'll forgive you ,
Whatever torment you do put me to .

Go , stand within : let me alone with him .

I am best pleas'd to be from such a deed .


Alas , I then have chid away my friend :
He hath a stern look , but a gentle heart .
Let him come back , that his compassion may 
Give life to yours .

Come , boy , prepare yourself .

Is there no remedy ?

None , but to lose your eyes .

O heaven , that there were but a mote in yours ,
A grain , a dust , a gnat , a wandering hair ,
Any annoyance in that precious sense ;
Then feeling what small things are boisterous there ,
Your vile intent must needs seem horrible .

Is this your promise , go to , hold your tongue .

Hubert , the utterance of a brace of tongues 
Must needs want pleading for a pair of eyes :
Let me not hold my tongue ; let me not , Hubert :
Or Hubert , if you will , cut out my tongue ,
So I may keep mine eyes : O , spare mine eyes ,
Though to no use but still to look on you :
Lo , by my troth , the instrument is cold 
And would not harm me .

I can heat it , boy .

No , in good sooth ; the fire is dead with grief ,
Being create for comfort , to be us'd 
In undeserv'd extremes : see else yourself ;
There is no malice in this burning coal ;
The breath of heaven hath blown his spirit out 
And strew'd repentant ashes on his head .

But with my breath I can revive it , boy .

An if you do you will but make it blush 
And glow with shame of your proceedings , Hubert :
Nay , it perchance will sparkle in your eyes ;
And like a dog that is compell'd to fight ,
Snatch at his master that doth tarre him on .
All things that you should use to do me wrong 
Deny their office : only you do lack 
That mercy which fierce fire and iron extends ,
Creatures of note for mercy-lacking uses .

Well , see to live ; I will not touch thine eyes 
For all the treasure that thine uncle owes :
Yet am I sworn and I did purpose , boy ,
With this same very iron to burn them out .

O , now you look like Hubert , all this while 
You were disguised .

Peace , no more . Adieu .
Your uncle must not know but you are dead ;
I'll fill these dogged spies with false reports :
And , pretty child , sleep doubtless and secure ,
That Hubert for the wealth of all the world 
Will not offend thee .

O heaven , I thank you , Hubert .

Silence , no more , go closely in with me :
Much danger do I undergo for thee .


Here once again we sit , once again crown'd ,
And look'd upon , I hope , with cheerful eyes .

This 'once again ,' but that your highness pleas'd ,
Was once superfluous : you were crown'd before ,
And that high royalty was ne'er pluck'd off ,
The faiths of men ne'er stained with revolt ;
Fresh expectation troubled not the land 
With any long'd-for change or better state .

Therefore , to be possess'd with double pomp ,
To guard a title that was rich before ,
To gild refined gold , to paint the lily ,
To throw a perfume on the violet ,
To smooth the ice , or add another hue 
Unto the rainbow , or with taper-light 
To seek the beauteous eye of heaven to garnish ,
Is wasteful and ridiculous excess .

But that your royal pleasure must be done ,
This act is as an ancient tale new told ,
And in the last repeating troublesome ,
Being urged at a time unseasonable .

In this the antique and well-noted face 
Of plain old form is much disfigured ;
And , like a shifted wind unto a sail ,
It makes the course of thoughts to fetch about ,
Startles and frights consideration ,
Makes sound opinion sick and truth suspected ,
For putting on so new a fashion'd robe .

When workmen strive to do better than well 
They do confound their skill in covetousness ;
And oftentimes excusing of a fault 
Doth make the fault the worse by the excuse :
As patches set upon a little breach 
Discredit more in hiding of the fault 
Than did the fault before it was so patch'd .

To this effect , before you were newcrown'd ,
We breath'd our counsel : but it pleas'd your highness 
To overbear it , and we are all well pleas'd ;
Since all and every part of what we would 
Doth make a stand at what your highness will .

Some reasons of this double coronation 
I have possess'd you with and think them strong ;
And more , more strong ,when lesser is my fear ,
I shall indue you with : meantime but ask 
What you would have reform'd that is not well ;
And well shall you perceive how willingly 
I will both hear and grant you your requests .

Then I ,as one that am the tongue of these 
To sound the purposes of all their hearts ,
Both for myself and them ,but , chief of all ,
Your safety , for the which myself and them 
Bend their best studies ,heartily request 
The enfranchisement of Arthur ; whose restraint 
Doth move the murmuring lips of discontent 
To break into this dangerous argument :
If what in rest you have in right you hold ,
Why then your fears ,which , as they say , attend 
The steps of wrong ,should move you to mew up 
Your tender kinsman , and to choke his days 
With barbarous ignorance , and deny his youth 
The rich advantage of good exercise ?
That the time's enemies may not have this 
To grace occasions , let it be our suit 
That you have bid us ask , his liberty ;
Which for our goods we do no further ask 
Than whereupon our weal , on you depending ,
Counts it your weal he have his liberty .


Let it be so : I do commit his youth 
To your direction . Hubert , what news with you ?


This is the man should do the bloody deed ;
He show'd his warrant to a friend of mine :
The image of a wicked hemous fault 
Lives in his eye ; that close aspect of his 
Does show the mood of a much troubled breast ;
And I do fearfully believe 'tis done ,
What we so fear'd he had a charge to do .

The colour of the king doth come and go 
Between his purpose and his conscience ,
Like heralds 'twixt two dreadful battles set :
His passion is so ripe it needs must break .

And when it breaks , I fear will issue thence 
The foul corruption of a sweet child's death .

We cannot hold mortality's strong hand :
Good lords , although my will to give is living ,
The suit which you demand is gone and dead :
He tells us Arthur is deceas'd to-night .

Indeed we fear'd his sickness was past cure .

Indeed we heard how near his death he was 
Before the child himself felt he was sick :
This must be answer'd , either here or hence .

Why do you bend such solemn brows on me ?
Think you I bear the shears of destiny ?
Have I commandment on the pulse of life ?

It is apparent foul play ; and 'tis shame 
That greatness should so grossly offer it :
So thrive it in your game , and so , farewell .

Stay yet , Lord Salisbury ; I'll go with thee ,
And find the inheritance of this poor child ,
His little kingdom of a forced grave .
That blood which ow'd the breadth of all this isle ,
Three foot of it doth hold : bad world the while !
This must not be thus borne : this will break out 
To all our sorrows , and ere long I doubt .


They burn in indignation . I repent :
There is no sure foundation set on blood ,
No certain life achiev'd by others' death .


A fearful eye thou hast : where is that blood 
That I have seen inhabit in those cheeks ?
So foul a sky clears not without a storm :

Pour down thy weather : how goes all in France ?

From France to England . Never such a power 
For any foreign preparation 
Was levied in the body of a land .
The copy of your speed is learn'd by them ;
For when you should be told they do prepare ,
The tidings come that they are all arriv'd .

O , where hath our intelligence been drunk ?
Where hath it slept , Where is my mother's care 
That such an army could be drawn in France ,
And she not hear of it ?

My liege , her ear 
Is stopp'd with dust : the first of April died 
Your noble mother ; and , as I hear , my lord ,
The Lady Constance in a frenzy died 
Three days before : but this from rumour's tongue 
I idly heard ; if true or false I know not .

Withhold thy speed , dreadful occasion !
O , make a league with me , till I have pleas'd 
My discontented peers . What , mother dead !
How wildly then walks my estate in France !
Under whose conduct came those powers of France 
That thou for truth giv'st out are landed here ?

Under the Dauphin .

Thou hast made me giddy 
With these ill tidings .


Now , what says the world 
To your proceedings , do not seek to stuff 

My head with more ill news , for it is full .

But if you be afeard to hear the worst ,
Then let the worst unheard fall on your head .

Bear with me , cousin , for I was amaz'd 
Under the tide ; but now I breathe again 
Aloft the flood , and can give audience 
To any tongue , speak it of what it will .

How I have sped among the clergymen ,
The sums I have collected shall express .
But as I travell'd hither through the land ,
I find the people strangely fantasied ,
Possess'd with rumours , full of idle dreams ,
Not knowing what they fear , but full of fear .
And here's a prophet that I brought with me 
From forth the streets of Pomfret , whom I found 
With many hundreds treading on his heels ;
To whom he sung , in rude harsh-sounding rimes ,
That , ere the next Ascension-day at noon ,
Your highness should deliver up your crown .

Thou idle dreamer , wherefore didst thou so ?

Foreknowing that the truth will fall out so .

Hubert , away with him ; imprison him :
And on that day at noon , whereon , he says ,
I shall yield up my crown , let him be hang'd .
Deliver him to safety , and return ,
For I must use thee .

O my gentle cousin ,
Hear'st thou the news abroad , who are arriv'd ?

The French , my lord ; men's mouths are full of it :
Besides , I met Lord Bigot and Lord Salisbury ,
With eyes as red as new-enkindled fire ,
And others more , going to seek the grave 
Of Arthur , whom they say is kill'd to-night 
On your suggestion .

Gentle kinsman , go ,
And thrust thyself into their companies .
I have a way to win their loves again ;
Bring them before me .

I will seek them out .

Nay , but make haste ; the better foot before .
O , let me have no subject enemies 
When adverse foreigners affright my towns 
With dreadful pomp of stout invasion .
Be Mercury , set feathers to thy heels ,
And fly like thought from them to me again .

The spirit of the time shall teach me speed .

Spoke like a sprightful noble gentleman .

Go after him ; for he perhaps shall need 
Some messenger betwixt me and the peers ;
And be thou he .

With all my heart , my liege .


My mother dead !


My lord , they say five moons were seen to-night :
Four fixed , and the fifth did whirl about 
The other four in wondrous motion .

Five moons !

Old men and beldams in the streets 
Do prophesy upon it dangerously :
Young Arthur's death is common in their mouths ;
And when they talk of him , they shake their heads 
And whisper one another in the ear ;
And he that speaks , doth gripe the hearer's wrist 
Whilst he that hears makes fearful action ,
With wrinkled brows , with nods , with rolling eyes .
I saw a smith stand with his hammer , thus ,
The whilst his iron did on the anvil cool ,
With open mouth swallowing a tailor's news ;
Who , with his shears and measure in his hand ,
Standing on slippers ,which his nimble haste 
Had falsely thrust upon contrary feet ,
Told of a many thousand warlike French ,
That were embattailed and rank'd in Kent .
Another lean unwash'd artificer 
Cuts off his tale and talks of Arthur's death .

Why seek'st thou to possess me with these fears ?
Why urgest thou so oft young Arthur's death ?
Thy hand hath murder'd him : I had a mighty cause 
To wish him dead , but thou hadst none to kill him .

No had , my lord , why , did you not provoke me ?

It is the curse of kings to be attended 
By slaves that take their humours for a warrant 
To break within the bloody house of life ,
And on the winking of authority 
To understand a law , to know the meaning 
Of dangerous majesty , when , perchance , it frowns 
More upon humour than advis'd respect .

Here is your hand and seal for what I did .

O , when the last account 'twixt heaven and earth 
Is to be made , then shall this hand and seal 
Witness against us to damnation .
How oft the sight of means to do ill deeds 
Makes ill deeds done , Hadst not thou been by ,
A fellow by the hand of nature mark'd ,
Quoted and sign'd to do a deed of shame ,
This murder had not come into my mind ;
But taking note of thy abhorr'd aspect ,
Finding thee fit for bloody villany ,
Apt , liable to be employ'd in danger ,
I faintly broke with thee of Arthur's death ;
And thou , to be endeared to a king ,
Made it no conscience to destroy a prince .

My lord ,

Hadst thou but shook thy head or made a pause 
When I spake darkly what I purposed ,
Or turn'd an eye of doubt upon my face ,
As bid me tell my tale in express words ,
Deep shame had struck me dumb , made me break off ,
And those thy fears might have wrought fears in me :
But thou didst understand me by my signs 
And didst in signs again parley with sin ;
Yea , without stop , didst let thy heart consent ,
And consequently thy rude hand to act 
The deed which both our tongues held vile to name .
Out of my sight , and never see me more !
My nobles leave me ; and my state is brav'd ,
Even at my gates , with ranks of foreign powers :
Nay , in the body of this fleshly land ,
This kingdom , this confine of blood and breath ,
Hostility and civil tumult reigns 
Between my conscience and my cousin's death .

Arm you against your other enemies ,
I'll make a peace between your soul and you .
Young Arthur is alive : this hand of mine 
Is yet a maiden and an innocent hand ,
Not painted with the crimson spots of blood .
Within this bosom never enter'd yet 
The dreadful motion of a murderous thought ;
And you have slander'd nature in my form ,
Which , howsoever rude exteriorly ,
Is yet the cover of a fairer mind 
Than to be butcher of an innocent child .

Doth Arthur live , O , haste thee to the peers ,
Throw this report on their incensed rage ,
And make them tame to their obedience .
Forgive the comment that my passion made 
Upon thy feature ; for my rage was blind ,
And foul imaginary eyes of blood 
Presented thee more hideous than thou art .
O , answer not ; but to my closet bring 
The angry lords , with all expedient haste .
I conjure thee but slowly ; run more fast .


The wall is high ; and yet will I leap down 
Good ground , be pitiful and hurt me not !
There's few or none do know me ; if they did ,
This ship-boy's semblance hath disguis'd me quite .
I am afraid ; and yet I'll venture it .
If I get down , and do not break my limbs ,
I'll find a thousand shifts to get away :
As good to die and go , as die and stay .

O me , my uncle's spirit is in these stones :
Heaven take my soul , and England keep my bones !

Lords , I will meet him at Saint Edmundsbury .
It is our safety , and we must embrace 
This gentle offer of the perilous time .

Who brought that letter from the cardinal ?

The Count Melun , a noble lord of France ;
Whose private with me of the Dauphin's love ,
Is much more general than these lines import .

To-morrow morning let us meet him then .

Or rather then set forward ; for 'twill be 
Two long days' journey , lords , or e'er we meet .


Once more to-day well met , distemper'd lords !
The king by me requests your presence straight .

The king hath dispossess'd himself of us :
We will not line his thin bestained cloak 
With our pure honours , nor attend the foot 
That leaves the print of blood where'er it walks .
Return and tell him so : we know the worst .

Whate'er you think , good words , I think , were best .

Our griefs , and not our manners , reason now .

But there is little reason in your grief ;
Therefore 'twere reason you had manners now .

Sir , sir , impatience hath his privilege .

'Tis true ; to hurt his master , no man else .

This is the prison .

What is he lies here ?

O death , made proud with pure and princely beauty !
The earth had not a hole to hide this deed .

Murder , as hating what himself hath done ,
Doth lay it open to urge on revenge .

Or when he doom'd this beauty to a grave ,
Found it too precious-princely for a grave .

Sir Richard , what think you , Have you beheld ,
Or have you read , or heard , or could you think ?
Or do you almost think , although you see ,
That you do see , could thought , without this object ,
Form such another , This is the very top ,
The height , the crest , or crest unto the crest ,
Of murder's arms : this is the bloodiest shame ,
The wildest savagery , the vilest stroke ,
That ever wall-eyed wrath or staring rage 
Presented to the tears of soft remorse .

All murders past do stand excus'd in this :
And this , so sole and so unmatchable ,
Shall give a holiness , a purity ,
To the yet unbegotten sin of times ;
And prove a deadly bloodshed but a jest ,
Exampled by this heinous spectacle .

It is a damned and a bloody work ;
The graceless action of a heavy hand ,
If that it be the work of any hand .

If that it be the work of any hand !
We had a kind of light what would ensue :
It is the shameful work of Hubert's hand ;
The practice and the purpose of the king :
From whose obedience I forbid my soul ,
Kneeling before this ruin of sweet life ,
And breathing to his breathless excellence 
The incense of a vow , a holy vow ,
Never to taste the pleasures of the world ,
Never to be infected with delight ,
Nor conversant with ease and idleness ,
Till I have set a glory to this hand ,
By giving it the worship of revenge .

Our souls religiously confirm thy words .

Our souls religiously confirm thy words .


Lords , I am hot with haste in seeking you :
Arthur doth live : the king hath sent for you .

O , he is bold and blushes not at death .
Avaunt , thou hateful villain , get thee gone .

I am no villain .

Must I rob the law ?

Your sword is bright , sir ; put it up again .

Not till I sheathe it in a murderer's skin .

Stand back , Lord Salisbury , stand back , I say :
By heaven , I think my sword's as sharp as yours .
I would not have you , lord , forget yourself ,
Nor tempt the danger of my true defence ;
Lest I , by marking of your rage , forget 
Your worth , your greatness , and nobility .

Out , dunghill , dar'st thou brave a nobleman ?

Not for my life ; but yet I dare defend 
My innocent life against an emperor .

Thou art a murderer .

Do not prove me so ;
Yet I am none . Whose tongue soe'er speaks false ,
Not truly speaks ; who speaks not truly , lies .

Cut him to pieces .

Keep the peace , I say .

Stand by , or I shall gall you , Faulconbridge .

Thou wert better gall the devil , Salisbury :
If thou but frown on me , or stir thy foot ,
Or teach thy hasty spleen to do me shame ,
I'll strike thee dead . Put up thy sword betime :
Or I'll so maul you and your toasting-iron ,
That you shall think the devil is come from hell .

What wilt thou do , renowned Faulconbridge ?
Second a villain and a murderer ?

Lord Bigot , I am none .

Who kill'd this prince ?

'Tis not an hour since I left him well :
I honour'd him , I lov'd him ; and will weep 
My date of life out for his sweet life's loss .

Trust not those cunning waters of his eyes ,
For villany is not without such rheum ;
And he , long traded in it , makes it seem 
Like rivers of remorse and innocency .
Away with me , all you whose souls abhor 
The uncleanly savours of a slaughter-house ;
For I am stifled with this smell of sin .

Away toward Bury ; to the Dauphin there !

There tell the king he may inquire us out .


Here's a good world , Knew you of this fair work ?
Beyond the infinite and boundless reach 
Of mercy , if thou didst this deed of death ,
Art thou damn'd , Hubert .

Do but hear me , sir .

Ha , I'll tell thee what ;
Thou art damn'd as black nay , nothing is so black ;
Thou art more deep damn'd than Prince Lucifer :
There is not yet so ugly a fiend of hell 
As thou shalt be , if thou didst kill this child .

Upon my soul ,

If thou didst but consent 
To this most cruel act , do but despair ;
And if thou want'st a cord , the smallest thread 
That ever spider twisted from her womb 
Will serve to strangle thee ; a rush will be a beam 
To hang thee on ; or wouldst thou drown thyself ,
Put but a little water in a spoon ,
And it shall be as all the ocean ,
Enough to stifle such a villain up .
I do suspect thee very grievously .

If I in act , consent , or sin of thought ,
Be guilty of the stealing that sweet breath 
Which was embounded in this beauteous clay ,
Let hell want pains enough to torture me .
I left him well .

Go , bear him in thine arms .
I am amaz'd , methinks , and lose my way 
Among the thorns and dangers of this world .
How easy dost thou take all England up !
From forth this morsel of dead royalty ,
The life , the right and truth of all this realm 
Is fled to heaven ; and England now is left 
To tug and scamble and to part by the teeth 
The unow'd interest of proud swelling state .
Now for the bare-pick'd bone of majesty 
Doth dogged war bristle his angry crest ,
And snarleth in the gentle eyes of peace :
Now powers from home and discontents at home 
Meet in one line ; and vast confusion waits ,
As doth a raven on a sick-fallen beast ,
The imminent decay of wrested pomp .
Now happy he whose cloak and ceinture can 
Hold out this tempest . Bear away that child 
And follow me with speed : I'll to the king :
A thousand businesses are brief in hand ,
And heaven itself doth frown upon the land .

Thus have I yielded up into your hand 
The circle of my glory .

Take again 
From this my hand , as holding of the pope ,
Your sovereign greatness and authority .

Now keep your holy word : go meet the French ,
And from his holiness use all your power 
To stop their marches 'fore we are inflam'd .
Our discontented counties do revolt ,
Our people quarrel with obedience ,
Swearing allegiance and the love of soul 
To stranger blood , to foreign royalty .
This inundation of mistemper'd humour 
Rests by you only to be qualified :
Then pause not ; for the present time's so sick ,
That present medicine must be minister'd ,
Or overthrow incurable ensues .

It was my breath that blew this tempest up 
Upon your stubborn usage of the pope ;
But since you are a gentle convertite ,
My tongue shall hush again this storm of war 
And make fair weather in your blustering land .
On this Ascension-day , remember well ,
Upon your oath of service to the pope ,
Go I to make the French lay down their arms .


Is this Ascension-day , Did not the prophet 
Say that before Ascension-day at noon 
My crown I should give off , Even so I have :
I did suppose it should be on constraint ;
But , heaven be thank'd , it is but voluntary .


All Kent hath yielded ; nothing there holds out 
But Dover Castle : London hath receiv'd ,
Like a kind host , the Dauphin and his powers :
Your nobles will not hear you , but are gone 
To offer service to your enemy ;
And wild amazement hurries up and down 
The little number of your doubtful friends .

Would not my lords return to me again 
After they heard young Arthur was alive ?

They found him dead and cast into the streets ,
An empty casket , where the jewel of life 
By some damn'd hand was robb'd and ta'en away .

That villain Hubert told me he did live .

So , on my soul , he did , for aught he knew .
But wherefore do you droop , why look you sad ?
Be great in act , as you have been in thought ;
Let not the world see fear and sad distrust 
Govern the motion of a kingly eye :
Be stirring as the time ; be fire with fire ;
Threaten the threatener , and outface the brow 
Of bragging horror : so shall inferior eyes ,
That borrow their behaviours from the great ,
Grow great by your example and put on 
The dauntless spirit of resolution .
Away , and glister like the god of war 
When he intendeth to become the field :
Show boldness and aspiring confidence .
What , shall they seek the lion in his den 
And fright him there , and make him tremble there ?
O , let it not be said . Forage , and run 
To meet displeasure further from the doors ,
And grapple with him ere he comes so nigh .

The legate of the pope hath been with me ,
And I have made a happy peace with him ;
And he hath promis'd to dismiss the powers 
Led by the Dauphin .

O inglorious league !
Shall we , upon the footing of our land ,
Send fair-play orders and make compromise ,
Insinuation , parley and base truce 
To arms invasive , shall a beardless boy ,
A cocker'd silken wanton , brave our fields ,
And flesh his spirit in a war-like soul ,
Mocking the air with colours idly spread ,
And find no check , Let us , my liege , to arms :
Perchance the cardinal cannot make your peace ;
Or if he do , let it at least be said 
They saw we had a purpose of defence .

Have thou the ordering of this present time .

Away then , with good courage , yet , I know ,
Our party may well meet a prouder foe .


My Lord Melun , let this be copied out ,
And keep it safe for our remembrance .
Return the precedent to these lords again ;
That , having our fair order written down ,
Both they and we , perusing o'er these notes ,
May know wherefore we took the sacrament ,
And keep our faiths firm and inviolable .

Upon our sides it never shall be broken .
And , noble Dauphin , albeit we swear 
A voluntary zeal , an unurg'd faith 
To your proceedings ; yet , believe me , prince ,
I am not glad that such a sore of time 
Should seek a plaster by contemn'd revolt ,
And heal the inveterate canker of one wound 
By making many . O , it grieves my soul 
That I must draw this metal from my side 
To be a widow-maker , O , and there 
Where honourable rescue and defence 
Cries out upon the name of Salisbury .
But such is the infection of the time ,
That , for the health and physic of our right ,
We cannot deal but with the very hand 
Of stern injustice and confused wrong .
And is't not pity , O my grieved friends !
That we , the sons and children of this isle ,
Were born to see so sad an hour as this ;
Wherein we step after a stranger march 
Upon her gentle bosom , and fill up 
Her enemies' ranks ,I must withdraw and weep 
Upon the spot of this enforced cause ,
To grace the gentry of a land remote ,
And follow unacquainted colours here ?
What , here , O nation , that thou couldst remove ;
That Neptune's arms , who clippeth thee about ,
Would bear thee from the knowledge of thyself ,
And gripple thee unto a pagan shore ;
Where these two Christian armies might combine 
The blood of malice in a vein of league ,
And not to spend it so unneighbourly !

A noble temper dost thou show in this ;
And great affections wrestling in thy bosom 
Do make an earthquake of nobility .
O , what a noble combat hast thou fought 
Between compulsion and a brave respect .
Let me wipe off this honourable dew ,
That silverly doth progress on thy cheeks :
My heart hath melted at a lady's tears ,
Being an ordinary inundation ;
But this effusion of such manly drops ,
This shower , blown up by tempest of the soul ,
Startles mine eyes , and makes me more amaz'd 
Than had I seen the vaulty top of heaven 
Figur'd quite o'er with burning meteors .
Lift up thy brow , renowned Salisbury ,
And with a great heart heave away this storm :
Commend these waters to those baby eyes 
That never saw the giant world enrag'd ;
Nor met with fortune other than at feasts ,
Full warm of blood , of mirth , of gossiping .
Come , come ; for thou shalt thrust thy hand as deep 
Into the purse of rich prosperity 
As Lewis himself : so , nobles , shall you all ,
That knit your sinews to the strength of mine .


And even there , methinks , an angel spake :
Look , where the holy legate comes apace ,
To give us warrant from the hand of heaven ,
And on our actions set the name of right 

With holy breath .

Hail , noble prince of France !
The next is this : King John hath reconcil'd 
Himself to Rome ; his spirit is come in 
That so stood out against the holy church ,
The great metropolis and see of Rome .
Therefore thy threat'ning colours now wind up ,
And tame the savage spirit of wild war ,
That , like a lion foster'd up at hand ,
It may lie gently at the foot of peace ,
And be no further harmful than in show .

Your grace shall pardon me ; I will not back :
I am too high-born to be propertied ,
To be a secondary at control ,
Or useful serving-man and instrument 
To any sovereign state throughout the world .
Your breath first kindled the dead coal of wars 
Between this chastis'd kingdom and myself ,
And brought in matter that should feed this fire ;
And now 'tis far too huge to be blown out 
With that same weak wind which enkindled it .
You taught me how to know the face of right ,
Acquainted me with interest to this land ,
Yea , thrust this enterprise into my heart ;
And come you now to tell me John hath made 
His peace with Rome , What is that peace to me ?
I , by the honour of my marriage-bed ,
After young Arthur , claim this land for mine ;
And , now it is half-conquer'd , must I back 
Because that John hath made his peace with Rome ?
Am I Rome's slave , What penny hath Rome borne ,
What men provided , what munition sent ,
To underprop this action , is't not I 
That undergo this charge , who else but I ,
And such as to my claim are liable ,
Sweat in this business and maintain this war ?
Have I not heard these islanders shout out ,
Vive le roy , as I have bank'd their towns ?
Have I not here the best cards for the game 
To win this easy match play'd for a crown ?
And shall I now give o'er the yielded set ?
No , no , on my soul , it never shall be said .

You look but on the outside of this work .

Outside or inside , I will not return 
Till my attempt so much be glorified 
As to my ample hope was promised 
Before I drew this gallant head of war ,
And cull'd these fiery spirits from the world ,
To outlook conquest and to win renown 
Even in the jaws of danger and of death .

What lusty trumpet thus doth summon us ?


According to the fair play of the world ,
Let me have audience ; I am sent to speak :
My holy Lord of Milan , from the king 
I come , to learn how you have dealt for him ;
And , as you answer , I do know the scope 
And warrant limited unto my tongue .

The Dauphin is too wilful-opposite ,
And will not temporize with my entreaties :
He flatly says he'll not lay down his arms .

By all the blood that ever fury breath'd ,
The youth says well . Now hear our English king ;
For thus his royalty doth speak in me .
He is prepar'd ; and reason too he should :
This apish and unmannerly approach ,
This harness'd masque and unadvised revel ,
This unhair'd sauciness and boyish troops ,
The king doth smile at ; and is well prepar'd 
To whip this dwarfish war , these pigmy arms ,
From out the circle of his territories .
That hand which had the strength , even at your door ,
To cudgel you and make you take the hatch ;
To dive , like buckets , in concealed wells ;
To crouch in litter of your stable planks :
To lie like pawns lock'd up in chests and trunks ;
To hug with swine ; to seek sweet safety out 
In vaults and prisons ; and to thrill and shake ,
Even at the crying of your nation's crow ,
Thinking this voice an armed Englishman :
Shall that victorious hand be feebled here 
That in your chambers gave you chastisement ?
No , Know , the gallant monarch is in arms ,
And like an eagle o'er his aiery towers ,
To souse annoyance that comes near his nest .
And you degenerate , you ingrate revolts ,
You bloody Neroes , ripping up the womb 
Of your dear mother England , blush for shame :
For your own ladies and pale-visag'd maids 
Like Amazons come tripping after drums ,
Their thimbles into armed gauntlets change ,
Their neelds to lances , and their gentle hearts 
To fierce and bloody inclination .

There end thy brave , and turn thy face in peace ;
We grant thou canst outscold us : fare thee well ;
We hold our time too precious to be spent 
With such a brabbler .

Give me leave to speak .

No , I will speak .

We will attend to neither .
Strike up the drums ; and let the tongue of war 
Plead for our interest and our being here .

Indeed , your drums , being beaten , will cry out ;
And so shall you , being beaten . Do but start 
An echo with the clamour of thy drum ,
And even at hand a drum is ready brac'd 
That shall reverberate all as loud as thine ;
Sound but another , and another shall 
As loud as thine rattle the welkin's ear 
And mock the deep-mouth'd thunder : for at hand ,
Not trusting to this halting legate here ,
Whom he hath us'd rather for sport than need ,
Is warlike John ; and in his forehead sits 
A bare-ribb'd death , whose office is this day 
To feast upon whole thousands of the French .

Strike up our drums , to find this danger out .

And thou shalt find it , Dauphin , do not doubt .


How goes the day with us , O , tell me , Hubert .

Badly , I fear . How fares your majesty ?

This fever , that hath troubled me so long ,
Lies heavy on me : O , my heart is sick .


My lord , your valiant kinsman , Faulconbridge ,
Desires your majesty to leave the field ,
And send him word by me which way you go .

Tell him , toward Swinstead , to the abbey there .

Be of good comfort : for the great supply 
That was expected by the Dauphin here ,
Are wrack'd three nights ago on Goodwin sands .
This news was brought to Richard but even now .
The French fight coldly , and retire themselves .

Ay me , this tyrant fever burns me up ,
And will not let me welcome this good news .
Set on toward Swinstead : to my litter straight ;
Weakness possesseth me , and I am faint .


I did not think the king so stor'd with friends .

Up once again ; put spirit in the French :
If they miscarry we miscarry too .

That misbegotten devil , Faulconbridge ,
In spite of spite , alone upholds the day .

They say King John , sore sick , hath left the field .


Lead me to the revolts of England here .

When we were happy we had other names .

It is the Count Melun .

Wounded to death .

Fly , noble English ; you are bought and sold ;
Unthread the rude eye of rebellion ,
And welcome home again discarded faith .
Seek out King John and fall before his feet ;
For if the French be lords of this loud day ,
He means to recompense the pains you take 
By cutting off your heads . Thus hath he sworn ,
And I with him , and many moe with me ,
Upon the altar at Saint Edmundsbury ;
Even on that altar where we swore to you 
Dear amity and everlasting love .

May this be possible , may this be true ?

Have I not hideous death within my view ,
Retaining but a quantity of life ,
Which bleeds away , even as a form of wax 
Resolveth from his figure 'gainst the fire ?
What in the world should make me now deceive ,
Since I must lose the use of all deceit ?
Why should I then be false , since it is true 
That I must die here and live hence by truth ?
I say again , if Lewis do win the day ,
He is forsworn , if e'er those eyes of yours 
Behold another day break in the east :
But even this night , whose black contagious breath 
Already smokes about the burning crest 
Of the old , feeble , and day-wearied sun ,
Even this ill night , your breathing shall expire ,
Paying the fine of rated treachery 
Even with a treacherous fine of all your lives ,
If Lewis by your assistance win the day .
Commend me to one Hubert with your king ;
The love of him , and this respect besides ,
For that my grandsire was an Englishman ,
Awakes my conscience to confess all this .
In lieu whereof , I pray you , bear me hence 
From forth the noise and rumour of the field ,
Where I may think the remnant of my thoughts 
In peace , and part this body and my soul 
With contemplation and devout desires .

We do believe thee : and beshrew my soul 
But I do love the favour and the form 
Of this most fair occasion , by the which 
We will untread the steps of damned flight ,
And like a bated and retired flood ,
Leaving our rankness and irregular course ,
Stoop low within those bounds we have o'erlook'd ,
And calmly run on in obedience ,
Even to our ocean , to our great King John .
My arm shall give thee help to bear thee hence ,
For I do see the cruel pangs of death 
Right in thine eye . Away , my friends , New flight ;
And happy newness , that intends old right .


The sun of heaven methought was loath to set ,
But stay'd and made the western welkin blush ,
When the English measur'd backward their own ground 
In faint retire . O , bravely came we off ,
When with a volley of our needless shot ,
After such bloody toil , we bid good night ,
And wound our tottering colours clearly up ,
Last in the field , and almost lords of it !


Where is my prince , the Dauphin ?

Here : what news ?

The Count Melun is slain ; the English lords ,
By his persuasion , are again fall'n off ;
And your supply , which you have wish'd so long ,
Are cast away and sunk , on Goodwin sands .

Ah , foul shrewd news , Beshrew thy very heart !
I did not think to be so sad to-night 
As this hath made me . Who was he that said 
King John did fly an hour or two before 
The stumbling night did part our weary powers ?

Whoever spoke it , it is true , my lord .

Well ; keep good quarter and good care to-night :
The day shall not be up so soon as I ,
To try the fair adventure of to-morrow .


Who's there , speak , ho , speak quickly , or I shoot .

A friend . What art thou ?

Of the part of England .

Whither dost thou go ?

What's that to thee , Why may not I demand 
Of thine affairs as well as thou of mine ?

Hubert , I think ?

Thou hast a perfect thought :
I will upon all hazards well believe 
Thou art my friend , that know'st my tongue so well .
Who art thou ?

Who thou wilt : and if thou please ,
Thou mayst befriend me so much as to think 
I come one way of the Plantagenets .

Unkind remembrance , thou and eyeless night 
Have done me shame : brave soldier , pardon me ,
That any accent breaking from thy tongue 
Should 'scape the true acquaintance of mine ear .

Come , come ; sans compliment , what news abroad ?

Why , here walk I in the black brow of night ,
To find you out .

Brief , then ; and what's the news ?

O , my sweet sir , news fitting to the night ,
Black , fearful , comfortless , and horrible .

Show me the very wound of this ill news :
I am no woman ; I'll not swound at it .

The king , I fear , is poison'd by a monk :
I left him almost speechless ; and broke out 
To acquaint you with this evil , that you might 
The better arm you to the sudden time 
Than if you had at leisure known of this .

How did he take it , who did taste to him ?

A monk , I tell you ; a resolved villain ,
Whose bowels suddenly burst out : the king 
Yet speaks , and peradventure may recover .

Whom didst thou leave to tend his majesty ?

Why , know you not , the lords are all come back ,
And brought Prince Henry in their company ;
At whose request the king hath pardon'd them ,
And they are all about his majesty .

Withhold thine indignation , mighty heaven ,
And tempt us not to bear above our power !
I'll tell thee , Hubert , half my power this night ,
Passing these flats , are taken by the tide ;
These Lincoln Washes have devoured them :
Myself , well-mounted , hardly have escap'd .
Away before , conduct me to the king ;
I doubt he will be dead or ere I come .


It is too late : the life of all his blood 
Is touch'd corruptibly ; and his pure brain ,
Which some suppose the soul's frail dwelling-house ,
Doth , by the idle comments that it makes ,
Foretell the ending of mortality .


His highness yet doth speak ; and holds belief 
That , being brought into the open air ,
It would allay the burning quality 
Of that fell poison which assaileth him .

Let him be brought into the orchard here .
Doth he still rage ?


He is more patient 
Than when you left him : even now he sung .

O , vanity of sickness , fierce extremes 
In their continuance will not feel themselves .
Death , having prey'd upon the outward parts ,
Leaves them invisible ; and his siege is now 
Against the mind , the which he pricks and wounds 
With many legions of strange fantasies ,
Which , in their throng and press to that last hold ,
Confound themselves . 'Tis strange that death should sing .
I am the cygnet to this pale faint swan ,
Who chants a doleful hymn to his own death ,
And from the organ-pipe of frailty sings 
His soul and body to their lasting rest 

Be of good comfort , prince ; for you are born 
To set a form upon that indigest 
Which he hath left so shapeless and so rude .


Ay , marry , now my soul hath elbow-room ;
It would not out at windows , nor at doors .
There is so hot a summer in my bosom 
That all my bowels crumble up to dust :
I am a scribbled form , drawn with a pen 
Upon a parchment , and against this fire 
Do I shrink up .

How fares your majesty ?

Poison'd , ill-fare ; dead , forsook , cast off ;
And none of you will bid the winter come 
To thrust his icy fingers in my maw ;
Nor let my kingdom's rivers take their course 
Through my burn'd bosom ; nor entreat the north 
To make his bleak winds kiss my parched lips 
And comfort me with cold . I do not ask you much :
I beg cold comfort ; and you are so strait 
And so ingrateful you deny me that .

O , that there were some virtue in my tears ,
That might relieve you .

The salt in them is hot .
Within me is a hell ; and there the poison 
Is as a fiend confin'd to tyrannize 
On unreprievable condemned blood .


O , I am scalded with my violent motion 
And spleen of speed to see your majesty .

O cousin , thou art come to set mine eye :
The tackle of my heart is crack'd and burn'd ,
And all the shrouds wherewith my life should sail 
Are turned to one thread , one little hair ;
My heart hath one poor string to stay it by ,
Which holds but till thy news be uttered ;
And then all this thou seest is but a clod 
And module of confounded royalty .

The Dauphin is preparing hitherward ,
Where heaven he knows how we shall answer him :
For in a night the best part of my power ,
As I upon advantage did remove ,
Were in the Washes all unwarily 
Devoured by the unexpected flood .


You breathe these dead news in as dead an ear .
My liege , my lord , But now a king , now thus .

Even so must I run on , and even so stop .
What surety of the world , what hope , what stay ,
When this was now a king , and now is clay ?

Art thou gone so , I do but stay behind 
To do the office for thee of revenge ,
And then my soul shall wait on thee to heaven ,
As it on earth hath been thy servant still .
Now , now , you stars , that move in your right spheres ,
Where be your powers , Show now your mended faiths ,
And instantly return with me again ,
To push destruction and perpetual shame 
Out of the weak door of our fainting land .
Straight let us seek , or straight we shall be sought :
The Dauphin rages at our very heels .

It seems you know not then so much as we .
The Cardinal Pandulph is within at rest ,
Who half an hour since came from the Dauphin ,
And brings from him such offers of our peace 
As we with honour and respect may take ,
With purpose presently to leave this war .

He will the rather do it when he sees 
Ourselves well sinewed to our defence .

Nay , it is in a manner done already ;
For many carriages he hath dispatch'd 
To the sea-side , and put his cause and quarrel 
To the disposing of the cardinal :
With whom yourself , myself , and other lords ,
If you think meet , this afternoon will post 
To consummate this business happily .

Let it be so . And you , my noble prince ,
With other princes that may best be spar'd ,
Shall wait upon your father's funeral .

At Worcester must his body be interr'd ;
For so he will'd it .

Thither shall it then .
And happily may your sweet self put on 
The lineal state and glory of the land !
To whom , with all submission , on my knee ,
I do bequeath my faithful services 
And true subjection everlastingly .

And the like tender of our love we make ,
To rest without a spot for evermore .

I have a kind soul that would give you thanks ,
And knows not how to do it but with tears .

O , let us pay the time but needful woe 
Since it hath been beforehand with our griefs .
This England never did , nor never shall ,
Lie at the proud foot of a conqueror ,
But when it first did help to wound itself .
Now these her princes are come home again ,
Come the three corners of the world in arms ,
And we shall shock them . Nought shall make us rue ,
If England to itself do rest but true .

THE LIFE OF KING HENRY V

Chorus .

O , for a Muse of fire , that would ascend 
The brightest heaven of invention ;
A kingdom for a stage , princes to act 
And monarchs to behold the swelling scene .
Then should the war-like Harry , like himself ,
Assume the port of Mars ; and at his heels ,
Leash'd in like hounds , should famine , sword , and fire 
Crouch for employment . But pardon , gentles all ,
The flat unraised spirits that hath dar'd 
On this unworthy scaffold to bring forth 
So great an object : can this cockpit hold 
The vasty fields of France , or may we cram 
Within this wooden O the very casques 
That did affright the air at Agincourt ?
O , pardon , since a crooked figure may 
Attest in little place a million ;
And let us , ciphers to this great accompt ,
On your imaginary forces work .
Suppose within the girdle of these walls 
Are now confin'd two mighty monarchies ,
Whose high upreared and abutting fronts 
The perilous narrow ocean parts asunder :
Piece out our imperfections with your thoughts :
Into a thousand parts divide one man ,
And make imaginary puissance ;
Think when we talk of horses that you see them 
Printing their proud hoofs i' the receiving earth ;
For 'tis your thoughts that now must deck our kings ,
Carry them here and there , jumping o'er times ,
Turning the accomplishment of many years 
Into an hour-glass : for the which supply ,
Admit me Chorus to this history ;
Who prologue-like your humble patience pray ,
Gently to hear , kindly to judge , our play .


My lord , I'll tell you ; that self bill is urg'd ,
Which in th' eleventh year of the last king's reign 
Was like , and had indeed against us pass'd ,
But that the scambling and unquiet time 
Did push it out of further question .

But how , my lord , shall we resist it now ?

It must be thought on . If it pass against us ,
We lose the better half of our possession ;
For all the temporal lands which men devout 
By testament have given to the church 
Would they strip from us ; being valu'd thus :
As much as would maintain , to the king's honour ,
Full fifteen earls and fifteen hundred knights ,
Six thousand and two hundred good esquires ;
And , to relief of lazars and weak age ,
Of indigent faint souls past corporal toil ,
A hundred almshouses right well supplied ;
And to the coffers of the king beside ,
A thousand pounds by the year . Thus runs the bill .

This would drink deep .

'Twould drink the cup and all .

But what prevention ?

The king is full of grace and fair regard .

And a true lover of the holy church .

The courses of his youth promis'd it not .
The breath no sooner left his father's body 
But that his wildness , mortified in him ,
Seem'd to die too ; yea , at that very moment ,
Consideration like an angel came ,
And whipp'd the offending Adam out of him ,
Leaving his body as a paradise ,
To envelop and contain celestial spirits .
Never was such a sudden scholar made ;
Never came reformation in a flood ,
With such a heady currance , scouring faults ;
Nor never Hydra-headed wilfulness 
So soon did lose his seat and all at once 
As in this king .

We are blessed in the change .

Hear him but reason in divinity ,
And , all-admiring , with an inward wish 
You would desire the king were made a prelate :
Hear him debate of commonwealth affairs ,
You would say it hath been all in all his study :
List his discourse of war , and you shall hear 
A fearful battle render'd you in music :
Turn him to any cause of policy ,
The Gordian knot of it he will unloose ,
Familiar as his garter ; that , when he speaks ,
The air , a charter'd libertine , is still ,
And the mute wonder lurketh in men's ears ,
To steal his sweet and honey'd sentences ;
So that the art and practic part of life 
Must be the mistress to this theoric :
Which is a wonder how his Grace should glean it ,
Since his addiction was to courses vain ;
His companies unletter'd , rude , and shallow ;
His hours fill'd up with riots , banquets , sports ;
And never noted in him any study ,
Any retirement , any sequestration 
From open haunts and popularity .

The strawberry grows underneath the nettle ,
And wholesome berries thrive and ripen best 
Neighbour'd by fruit of baser quality :
And so the prince obscur'd his contemplation 
Under the veil of wildness ; which , no doubt ,
Grew like the summer grass , fastest by night ,
Unseen , yet crescive in his faculty .

It must be so ; for miracles are ceas'd ;
And therefore we must needs admit the means 
How things are perfected .

But , my good lord ,
How now for mitigation of this bill 
Urg'd by the commons , Doth his majesty 
Incline to it , or no ?

He seems indifferent ,
Or rather swaying more upon our part 
Than cherishing the exhibiters against us ;
For I have made an offer to his majesty ,
Upon our spiritual convocation ,
And in regard of causes now in hand ,
Which I have open'd to his Grace at large ,
As touching France , to give a greater sum 
Than ever at one time the clergy yet 
Did to his predecessors part withal .

How did this offer seem receiv'd , my lord ?

With good acceptance of his majesty ;
Save that there was not time enough to hear ,
As I perceiv'd his Grace would fain have done ,
The severals and unhidden passages 
Of his true titles to some certain dukedoms ,
And generally to the crown and seat of France ,
Deriv'd from Edward , his great-grandfather .

What was the impediment that broke this off ?

The French ambassador upon that instant 
Crav'd audience ; and the hour I think is come 
To give him hearing : is it four o'clock ?

It is .

Then go we in to know his embassy ;
Which I could with a ready guess declare 
Before the Frenchman speak a word of it .

I'll wait upon you , and I long to hear it .


Where is my gracious lord of Canterbury ?

Not here in presence .

Send for him , good uncle .

Shall we call in the ambassador , my liege ?

Not yet , my cousin : we would be resolv'd ,
Before we hear him , of some things of weight 
That task our thoughts , concerning us and France .


God and his angels guard your sacred throne ,
And make you long become it !

Sure , we thank you .
My learned lord , we pray you to proceed ,
And justly and religiously unfold 
Why the law Salique that they have in France 
Or should , or should not , bar us in our claim .
And God forbid , my dear and faithful lord ,
That you should fashion , wrest , or bow your reading ,
Or nicely charge your understanding soul 
With opening titles miscreate , whose right 
Suits not in native colours with the truth ;
For God doth know how many now in health 
Shall drop their blood in approbation 
Of what your reverence shall incite us to .
Therefore take heed how you impawn our person ,
How you awake the sleeping sword of war :
We charge you in the name of God , take heed ;
For never two such kingdoms did contend 
Without much fall of blood ; whose guiltless drops 
Are every one a woe , a sore complaint ,
'Gainst him whose wrongs give edge unto the swords 
That make such waste in brief mortality .
Under this conjuration speak , my lord ,
And we will hear , note , and believe in heart ,
That what you speak is in your conscience wash'd 
As pure as sin with baptism .

Then hear me , gracious sovereign , and you peers ,
That owe yourselves , your lives , and services 
To this imperial throne . There is no bar 
To make against your highness' claim to France 
But this , which they produce from Pharamond ,
In terram Salicam mulieres ne succedant ,
'No woman shall succeed in Salique land :' 
Which Salique land the French unjustly gloze 
To be the realm of France , and Pharamond 
The founder of this law and female bar .
Yet their own authors faithfully affirm 
That the land Salique is in Germany ,
Between the floods of Sala and of Elbe ;
Where Charles the Great , having subdu'd the Saxons ,
There left behind and settled certain French ;
Who , holding in disdain the German women 
For some dishonest manners of their life ,
Establish'd then this law ; to wit , no female 
Should be inheritrix in Salique land :
Which Salique , as I said , 'twixt Elbe and Sala ,
Is at this day in Germany call'd Meisen .
Then doth it well appear the Salique law 
Was not devised for the realm of France ;
Nor did the French possess the Salique land 
Until four hundred one-and-twenty years 
After defunction of King Pharamond ,
Idly suppos'd the founder of this law ;
Who died within the year of our redemption 
Four hundred twenty-six ; and Charles the Great 
Subdu'd the Saxons , and did seat the French 
Beyond the river Sala , in the year 
Eight hundred five . Besides , their writers say ,
King Pepin , which deposed Childeric ,
Did , as heir general , being descended 
Of Blithild , which was daughter to King Clothair ,
Make claim and title to the crown of France .
Hugh Capet also , who usurp'd the crown 
Of Charles the Duke of Loraine , sole heir male 
Of the true line and stock of Charles the Great ,
To find his title with some shows of truth ,
Though in pure truth , it was corrupt and naught ,
Convey'd himself as heir to the Lady Lingare ,
Daughter to Charlemain , who was the son 
To Lewis the emperor , and Lewis the son 
Of Charles the Great . Also King Lewis the Tenth ,
Who was sole heir to the usurper Capet ,
Could not keep quiet in his conscience ,
Wearing the crown of France , till satisfied 
That fair Queen Isabel , his grandmother ,
Was lineal of the Lady Ermengare ,
Daughter to Charles the aforesaid Duke of Loraine :
By the which marriage the line of Charles the Great 
Was re-united to the crown of France .
So that , as clear as is the summer's sun ,
King Pepin's title , and Hugh Capet's claim ,
King Lewis his satisfaction , all appear 
To hold in right and title of the female :
So do the kings of France unto this day ;
Howbeit they would hold up this Salique law 
To bar your highness claiming from the female ;
And rather choose to hide them in a net 
Than amply to imbar their crooked titles 
Usurp'd from you and your progenitors .

May I with right and conscience make this claim ?

The sin upon my head , dread sovereign !
For in the book of Numbers is it writ :
'When the son dies , let the inheritance 
Descend unto the daughter .' Gracious lord ,
Stand for your own ; unwind your bloody flag ;
Look back into your mighty ancestors :
Go , my dread lord , to your great-grandsire's tomb ,
From whom you claim ; invoke his war-like spirit ,
And your great-uncle's , Edward the Black Prince ,
Who on the French ground play'd a tragedy ,
Making defeat on the full power of France ;
Whiles his most mighty father on a hill 
Stood smiling to behold his lion's whelp 
Forage in blood of French nobility .
O noble English , that could entertain 
With half their forces the full pride of France ,
And let another half stand laughing by ,
All out of work , and cold for action .

Awake remembrance of these valiant dead ,
And with your puissant arm renew their feats :
You are their heir , you sit upon their throne ,
The blood and courage that renowned them 
Runs in your veins ; and my thrice-puissantliege 
Is in the very May-morn of his youth ,
Ripe for exploits and mighty enterprises .

Your brother kings and monarchs of the earth 
Do all expect that you should rouse yourself ,
As did the former lions of your blood .

They know your Grace hath cause and means and might ;
So hath your highness ; never King of England 
Had nobles richer , and more loyal subjects ,
Whose hearts have left their bodies here in England 
And lie pavilion'd in the fields of France .

O , let their bodies follow , my dear liege ,
With blood and sword and fire to win your right ;
In aid whereof we of the spiritualty 
Will raise your highness such a mighty sum 
As never did the clergy at one time 
Bring in to any of your ancestors .

We must not only arm to invade the French ,
But lay down our proportions to defend 
Against the Scot , who will make road upon us 
With all advantages .

They of those marches , gracious sovereign ,
Shall be a wall sufficient to defend 
Our inland from the pilfering borderers .

We do not mean the coursing snatchers only ,
But fear the main intendment of the Scot ,
Who hath been still a giddy neighbour to us ;
For you shall read that my great-grandfather 
Never went with his forces into France 
But that the Scot on his unfurnish'd kingdom 
Came pouring , like the tide into a breach ,
With ample and brim fulness of his force ,
Galling the gleaned land with hot essays ,
Girding with grievous siege castles and towns ;
That England , being empty of defence ,
Hath shook and trembled at the ill neighbourhood .

She hath been then more fear'd than harm'd , my liege ;
For hear her but exampled by herself :
When all her chivalry hath been in France 
And she a mourning widow of her nobles ,
She hath herself not only well defended ,
But taken and impounded as a stray 
The King of Scots ; whom she did send to France ,
To fill King Edward's fame with prisoner kings ,
And make your chronicle as rich with praise 
As is the owse and bottom of the sea 
With sunken wrack and sumless treasuries .

But there's a saying very old and true ;

If that you will France win ,
Then with Scotland first begin :

For once the eagle England being in prey ,
To her unguarded nest the weasel Scot 
Comes sneaking and so sucks her princely eggs ,
Playing the mouse in absence of the cat ,
To tear and havoc more than she can eat .

It follows then the cat must stay at home :
Yet that is but a crush'd necessity ;
Since we have locks to safeguard necessaries 
And pretty traps to catch the petty thieves .
While that the armed hand doth fight abroad 
The advised head defends itself at home :
For government , though high and low and lower ,
Put into parts , doth keep in one consent ,
Congreeing in a full and natural close ,
Like music .

Therefore doth heaven divide 
The state of man in divers functions ,
Setting endeavour in continual motion ;
To which is fixed , as an aim or butt ,
Obedience : for so work the honey-bees ,
Creatures that by a rule in nature teach 
The act of order to a peopled kingdom .
They have a king and officers of sorts ;
Where some , like magistrates , correct at home ,
Others , like merchants , venture trade abroad ,
Others , like soldiers , armed in their stings ,
Make boot upon the summer's velvet buds ;
Which pillage they with merry march bring home 
To the tent-royal of their emperor :
Who , busied in his majesty , surveys 
The singing masons building roofs of gold ,
The civil citizens kneading up the honey ,
The poor mechanic porters crowding in 
Their heavy burdens at his narrow gate ,
The sad-ey'd justice , with his surly hum ,
Delivering o'er to executors pale 
The lazy yawning drone . I this infer ,
That many things , having full reference 
To one consent , may work contrariously ;
As many arrows , loosed several ways ,
Fly to one mark ; as many ways meet in one town ;
As many fresh streams meet in one salt sea ;
As many lines close in the dial's centre ;
So may a thousand actions , once afoot ,
End in one purpose , and be all well borne 
Without defeat . Therefore to France , my liege .
Divide your happy England into four ;
Whereof take you one quarter into France ,
And you withal shall make all Gallia shake .
If we , with thrice such powers left at home ,
Cannot defend our own doors from the dog ,
Let us be worried and our nation lose 
The name of hardiness and policy .

Call in the messengers sent from the Dauphin .

Now are we well resolv'd ; and by God's help ,
And yours , the noble sinews of our power ,
France being ours , we'll bend it to our awe 
Or break it all to pieces : or there we'll sit ,
Ruling in large and ample empery 
O'er France and all her almost kingly dukedoms ,
Or lay these bones in an unworthy urn ,
Tombless , with no remembrance over them :
Either our history shall with full mouth 
Speak freely of our acts , or else our grave ,
Like Turkish mute , shall have a tongueless mouth ,
Not worshipp'd with a waxen epitaph .


Now are we well prepar'd to know the pleasure 
Of our fair cousin Dauphin ; for we hear 

Your greeting is from him , not from the king .

May't please your majesty to give us leave 
Freely to render what we have in charge ;
Or shall we sparingly show you far off 
The Dauphin's meaning and our embassy ?

We are no tyrant , but a Christian king ;
Unto whose grace our passion is as subject 
As are our wretches fetter'd in our prisons :
Therefore with frank and with uncurbed plainness 
Tell us the Dauphin's mind .

Thus then , in few .
Your highness , lately sending into France ,
Did claim some certain dukedoms , in the right 
Of your great predecessor , King Edward the Third .
In answer of which claim , the prince our master 
Says that you savour too much of your youth ,
And bids you be advis'd there's nought in France 
That can be with a nimble galliard won ;
You cannot revel into dukedoms there .
He therefore sends you , meeter for your spirit ,
This tun of treasure ; and , in lieu of this ,
Desires you let the dukedoms that you claim 
Hear no more of you . This the Dauphin speaks .

What treasure , uncle ?

Tennis-balls , my liege .

We are glad the Dauphin is so pleasant with us :
His present and your pains we thank you for :
When we have match'd our rackets to these balls ,
We will in France , by God's grace , play a set 
Shall strike his father's crown into the hazard .
Tell him he hath made a match with such a wrangler 
That all the courts of France will be disturb'd 
With chaces . And we understand him well ,
How he comes o'er us with our wilder days ,
Not measuring what use we made of them .
We never valu'd this poor seat of England ;
And therefore , living hence , did give ourself 
To barbarous licence ; as 'tis ever common 
That men are merriest when they are from home .
But tell the Dauphin I will keep my state ,
Be like a king and show my sail of greatness 
When I do rouse me in my throne of France :
For that I have laid by my majesty 
And plodded like a man for working-days ,
But I will rise there with so full a glory 
That I will dazzle all the eyes of France ,
Yea , strike the Dauphin blind to look on us .
And tell the pleasant prince this mock of his 
Hath turn'd his balls to gun-stones ; and his soul 
Shall stand sore-charged for the wasteful vengeance 
That shall fly with them : for many a thousand widows 
Shall this his mock mock out of their dear husbands ;
Mock mothers from their sons , mock castles down ;
And some are yet ungotten and unborn 
That shall have cause to curse the Dauphin's scorn .
But this lies all within the will of God ,
To whom I do appeal ; and in whose name 
Tell you the Dauphin I am coming on ,
To venge me as I may and to put forth 
My rightful hand in a well-hallow'd cause .
So get you hence in peace ; and tell the Dauphin 
His jest will savour but of shallow wit 
When thousands weep more than did laugh at it .
Convey them with safe conduct . Fare you well .


This was a merry message .

We hope to make the sender blush at it .
Therefore , my lords , omit no happy hour 
That may give furtherance to our expedition ;
For we have now no thought in us but France ,
Save those to God , that run before our business .
Therefore let our proportions for these wars 
Be soon collected , and all things thought upon 
That may with reasonable swiftness add 
More feathers to our wings ; for , God before ,
We'll chide this Dauphin at his father's door .
Therefore let every man now task his thought ,
That this fair action may on foot be brought .

Now all the youth of England are on fire ,
And silken dalliance in the wardrobe lies ;
Now thrive the armourers , and honour's thought 
Reigns solely in the breast of every man :
They sell the pasture now to buy the horse ,
Following the mirror of all Christian kings ,
With winged heels , as English Mercuries .
For now sits Expectation in the air 
And hides a sword from hilts unto the point 
With crowns imperial , crowns and coronets ,
Promis'd to Harry and his followers .
The French , advis'd by good intelligence 
Of this most dreadful preparation ,
Shake in their fear , and with pale policy 
Seek to divert the English purposes .
O England , model to thy inward greatness ,
Like little body with a mighty heart ,
What mightst thou do , that honour would thee do ,
Were all thy children kind and natural !
But see thy fault , France hath in thee found out 
A nest of hollow bosoms , which he fills 
With treacherous crowns ; and three corrupted men ,
One , Richard Earl of Cambridge , and the second ,
Henry Lord Scroop of Masham , and the third ,
Sir Thomas Grey , knight , of Northumberland ,
Have , for the gilt of France ,O guilt , indeed !
Confirm'd conspiracy with fearful France ;
And by their hands this grace of kings must die ,
If hell and treason hold their promises ,
Ere he take ship for France , and in Southampton .
Linger your patience on ; and well digest 
The abuse of distance while we force a play .
The sum is paid ; the traitors are agreed ;
The king is set from London ; and the scene 
Is now transported , gentles , to Southampton :
There is the playhouse now , there must you sit :
And thence to France shall we convey you safe ,
And bring you back , charming the narrow seas 
To give you gentle pass ; for , if we may ,
We'll not offend one stomach with our play .
But , till the king come forth and not till then ,
Unto Southampton do we shift our scene .

Well met , Corporal Nym .

Good morrow , Lieutenant Bardolph .

What , are Ancient Pistol and you friends yet ?

For my part , I care not : I say little ; but when time shall serve , there shall be smiles ; but that shall be as it may . I dare not fight ; but I will wink and hold out mine iron . It is a simple one ; but what though , it will toast cheese , and it will endure cold as another man's sword will : and there's an end .

I will bestow a breakfast to make you friends , and we'll be all three sworn brothers to France : let it be so , good Corporal Nym .

Faith , I will live so long as I may , that's the certain of it ; and when I cannot live any longer , I will do as I may : that is my rest , that is the rendezvous of it .

It is certain , corporal , that he is married to Nell Quickly ; and , certainly she did you wrong , for you were troth-plight to her .

I cannot tell ; things must be as they may : men may sleep , and they may have their throats about them at that time ; and , some say , knives have edges . It must be as it may : though patience be a tired mare , yet she will plod . There must be conclusions . Well , I cannot tell .


Here comes Ancient Pistol and his wife . Good corporal , be patient here . How now , mine host Pistol !

Base tike , call'st thou me host ?
Now , by this hand , I swear , I scorn the term ;
Nor shall my Nell keep lodgers .

No , by my troth , not long ; for we cannot lodge and board a dozen or fourteen gentlewomen that live honestly by the prick of their needles , but it will be thought we keep a bawdy-house straight . [ 

Good lieutenant , good corporal , offer nothing here .

Pish !

Pish for thee , Iceland dog , thou prickeared cur of Iceland !

Good Corporal Nym , show thy valour and put up your sword .

Will you shog off , I would have you solus .


Solus , egregious dog , O viper vile !
The solus in thy most mervailous face ;
The solus in thy teeth , and in thy throat ,
And in thy hateful lungs , yea , in thy maw , perdy ;
And , which is worse , within thy nasty mouth !
I do retort the solus in thy bowels ;
For I can take , and Pistol's cock is up ,
And flashing fire will follow .

I am not Barbason ; you cannot conjure me . I have an humour to knock you indifferently well . If you grow foul with me , Pistol , I will scour you with my rapier , as I may , in fair terms : if you would walk off , I would prick your guts a little , in good terms , as I may ; and that's the humour of it .

O braggart vile and damned furious wight !
The grave doth gape , and doting death is near ;
Therefore exhale .

Hear me , hear me what I say : he that strikes the first stroke , I'll run him up to the hilts , as I am a soldier .


An oath of mickle might , and fury shall abate .
Give me thy fist , thy fore-foot to me give ;
Thy spirits are most tall .

I will cut thy throat , one time or other , in fair terms ; that is the humour of it .

Coupe le gorge !
That is the word . I thee defy again .
O hound of Crete , think'st thou my spouse to get ?
No ; to the spital go ,
And from the powdering-tub of infamy 
Fetch forth the lazar kite of Cressid's kind ,
Doll Tearsheet she by name , and her espouse :
I have , and I will hold , the quondam Quickly 
For the only she ; and pauca , there's enough .
Go to 


Mine host Pistol , you must come to my master , and your hostess : he is very sick , and would to bed . Good Bardolph , put thy face between his sheets and do the office of a warming-pan . Faith , he's very ill .

Away , you rogue !

By my troth , he'll yield the crow a pudding one of these days . The king has killed his heart . Good husband , come home presently .


Come , shall I make you two friends , We must to France together . Why the devil should we keep knives to cut one another's throats ?

Let floods o'erswell , and fiends for food howl on !

You'll pay me the eight shillings I won of you at betting ?

Base is the slave that pays .

That now I will have ; that's the humour of it .

As manhood shall compound : push home .


By this sword , he that makes the first thrust , I'll kill him ; by this sword , I will .

Sword is an oath , and oaths must have their course .

Corporal Nym , an thou wilt be friends , be friends : an thou wilt not , why then , be enemies with me too . Prithee , put up .

I shall have my eight shillings I won of you at betting ?

A noble shalt thou have , and present pay ;
And liquor likewise will I give to thee ,
And friendship shall combine , and brotherhood :
I'll live by Nym , and Nym shall live by me .
Is not this just , for I shall sutler be 
Unto the camp , and profits will accrue .
Give me thy hand .

I shall have my noble ?

In cash most justly paid .


Well then , that's the humour of it .


As ever you came of women , come in quickly to Sir John . Ah , poor heart , he is so shaked of a burning quotidian tertian , that it is most lamentable to behold . Sweet men , come to him .

The king hath run bad humours on the knight ; that's the even of it .

Nym , thou hast spoke the right ;
His heart is fracted and corroborate .

The king is a good king : but it must be as it may ; he passes some humours and careers .

Let us condole the knight ; for , lambkins , we will live .


'Fore God , his Grace is bold to trust these traitors .

They shall be apprehended by and by .

How smooth and even they do bear themselves !
As if allegiance in their bosoms sat ,
Crowned with faith and constant loyalty .

The king hath note of all that they intend ,
By interception which they dream not of .

Nay , but the man that was his bedfellow ,
Whom he hath dull'd and cloy'd with gracious favours ,
That he should , for a foreign purse , so sell 
His sovereign's life to death and treachery !


Now sits the wind fair , and we will aboard .
My Lord of Cambridge , and my kind Lord of Masham ,
And you , my gentle knight , give me your thoughts :
Think you not that the powers we bear with us 
Will cut their passage through the force of France ,
Doing the execution and the act 
For which we have in head assembled them ?

No doubt , my liege , if each man do his best .

I doubt not that ; since we are well persuaded 
We carry not a heart with us from hence 
That grows not in a fair consent with ours ;
Nor leave not one behind that doth not wish 
Success and conquest to attend on us .

Never was monarch better fear'd and lov'd 
Than is your majesty : there's not , I think , a subject 
That sits in heart-grief and uneasiness 
Under the sweet shade of your government .

True : those that were your father's enemies 
Have steep'd their galls in honey , and do serve you 
With hearts create of duty and of zeal .

We therefore have great cause of thankfulness ,
And shall forget the office of our hand ,
Sooner than quittance of desert and merit 
According to the weight and worthiness .

So service shall with steeled sinews toil ,
And labour shall refresh itself with hope ,
To do your Grace incessant services .

We judge no less . Uncle of Exeter ,
Enlarge the man committed yesterday 
That rail'd against our person : we consider 
It was excess of wine that set him on ;
And on his more advice we pardon him .

That's mercy , but too much security :
Let him be punish'd , sovereign , lest example 
Breed , by his sufference , more of such a kind .

O , let us yet be merciful .

So may your highness , and yet punish too .

Sir ,
You show great mercy , if you give him life 
After the taste of much correction .

Alas , your too much love and care of me 
Are heavy orisons 'gainst this poor wretch .
If little faults , proceeding on distemper ,
Shall not be wink'd at , how shall we stretch our eye 
When capital crimes , chew'd , swallow'd , and digested ,
Appear before us , We'll yet enlarge that man ,
Though Cambridge , Scroop , and Grey , in their dear care ,
And tender preservation of our person ,
Would have him punish'd . And now to our French causes :
Who are the late commissioners ?

I one , my lord :
Your highness bade me ask for it to-day .

So did you me , my liege .

And I , my royal sovereign .

Then , Richard , Earl of Cambridge , there is yours ;
There yours , Lord Scroop of Masham ; and , sir knight ,
Grey of Northumberland , this same is yours :
Read them ; and know , I know your worthiness .
My Lord of Westmoreland , and uncle Exeter ,
We will aboard to-night . Why , how now , gentlemen !
What see you in those papers that you lose 
So much complexion , Look ye , how they change !
Their cheeks are paper . Why , what read you there ,
That hath so cowarded and chas'd your blood 
Out of appearance ?

I do confess my fault ,
And do submit me to your highness' mercy .

To which we all appeal .

To which we all appeal .

The mercy that was quick in us but late 
By your own counsel is suppress'd and kill'd :
You must not dare , for shame , to talk of mercy ;
For your own reasons turn into your bosoms ,
As dogs upon their masters , worrying you .
See you , my princes and my noble peers ,
These English monsters , My Lord of Cambridge here ,
You know how apt our love was to accord 
To furnish him with all appertinents 
Belonging to his honour ; and this man 
Hath , for a few light crowns , lightly conspir'd ,
And sworn unto the practices of France ,
To kill us here in Hampton : to the which 
This knight , no less for bounty bound to us 
Than Cambridge is , hath likewise sworn . But O !
What shall I say to thee , Lord Scroop , thou cruel ,
Ingrateful , savage and inhuman creature !
Thou that didst bear the key of all my counsels ,
That knew'st the very bottom of my soul ,
That almost mightst have coin'd me into gold 
Wouldst thou have practis'd on me for thy use !
May it be possible that foreign hire 
Could out of thee extract one spark of evil 
That might annoy my finger , 'tis so strange 
That , though the truth of it stands off as gross 
As black from white , my eye will scarcely see it .
Treason and murder ever kept together ,
As two yoke-devils sworn to either's purpose ,
Working so grossly in a natural cause 
That admiration did not whoop at them :
But thou , 'gainst all proportion , didst bring in 
Wonder to wait on treason and on murder :
And whatsoever cunning fiend it was 
That wrought upon thee so preposterously 
Hath got the voice in hell for excellence :
And other devils that suggest by treasons 
Do botch and bungle up damnation 
With patches , colours , and with forms , being fetch'd 
From glistering semblances of piety ;
But he that temper'd thee bade thee stand up ,
Gave thee no instance why thou shouldst do treason ,
Unless to dub thee with the name of traitor .
If that same demon that hath gull'd thee thus 
Should with his lion gait walk the whole world ,
He might return to vasty Tartar back ,
And tell the legions , 'I can never win 
A soul so easy as that Englishman's .' 
O , how hast thou with jealousy infected 
The sweetness of affiance . Show men dutiful ?
Why , so didst thou : seem they grave and learned ?
Why , so didst thou : come they of noble family ?
Why , so didst thou : seem they religious ?
Why , so didst thou : or are they spare in diet ,
Free from gross passion or of mirth or anger ,
Constant in spirit , not swerving with the blood ,
Garnish'd and deck'd in modest complement ,
Not working with the eye without the ear ,
And but in purged judgment trusting neither ?
Such and so finely bolted didst thou seem :
And thus thy fall hath left a kind of blot ,
To mark the full-fraught man and best indu'd 
With some suspicion . I will weep for thee ;
For this revolt of thine , methinks , is like 
Another fall of man . Their faults are open :
Arrest them to the answer of the law ;
And God acquit them of their practices !

I arrest thee of high treason , by the name of Richard Earl of Cambridge .
I arrest thee of high treason , by the name of Henry Lord Scroop of Masham .
I arrest thee of high treason , by the name of Thomas Grey , knight , of Northumberland .

Our purposes God justly hath discover'd ,
And I repent my fault more than my death ;
Which I beseech your highness to forgive ,
Although my body pay the price of it .

For me , the gold of France did not seduce ,
Although I did admit it as a motive 
The sooner to effect what I intended :
But God be thanked for prevention ;
Which I in sufference heartily will rejoice ,
Beseeching God and you to pardon me .

Never did faithful subject more rejoice 
At the discovery of most dangerous treason 
Than I do at this hour joy o'er myself ,
Prevented from a damned enterprise .
My fault , but not my body ; pardon , sovereign .

God quit you in his mercy , Hear your sentence .
You have conspir'd against our royal person ,
Join'd with an enemy proclaim'd , and from his coffers 
Receiv'd the golden earnest of our death ;
Wherein you would have sold your king to slaughter ,
His princes and his peers to servitude ,
His subjects to oppression and contempt ,
And his whole kingdom into desolation .
Touching our person seek we no revenge ;
But we our kingdom's safety must so tender ,
Whose ruin you have sought , that to her laws 
We do deliver you . Get you therefore hence ,
Poor miserable wretches , to your death ;
The taste whereof , God of his mercy give you 
Patience to endure , and true repentance 
Of all your dear offences , Bear them hence .

Now , lords , for France , the enterprise whereof 
Shall be to you , as us , like glorious .
We doubt not of a fair and lucky war ,
Since God so graciously hath brought to light 
This dangerous treason lurking in our way 
To hinder our beginnings . We doubt not now 
But every rub is smoothed on our way .
Then forth , dear countrymen : let us deliver 
Our puissance into the hand of God ,
Putting it straight in expedition .
Cheerly to sea , the signs of war advance :
No king of England , if not king of France .


Prithee , honey-sweet husband , let me bring thee to Staines .

No ; for my manly heart doth yearn .
Bardolph , be blithe ; Nym , rouse thy vaunting veins ;
Boy , bristle thy courage up ; for Falstaff he is dead ,
And we must yearn therefore .

Would I were with him , wheresome'er he is , either in heaven or in hell !

Nay , sure , he's not in hell : he's in Arthur's bosom , if ever man went to Arthur's bosom . A' made a finer end and went away an it had been any christom child ; a' parted even just between twelve and one , even at the turning o' the tide : for after I saw him fumble with the sheets and play with flowers and smile upon his fingers' ends , I knew there was but one way ; for his nose was as sharp as a pen , and a' babbled of green fields . 'How now , Sir John !' quoth I : 'what man , be of good cheer .' So a' cried out 'God , God , God !' three or four times : now I , to comfort him , bid him a' should not think of God , I hoped there was no need to trouble himself with any such thoughts yet . So a' bade me lay more clothes on his feet : I put my hand into the bed and felt them , and they were as cold as any stone ; then I felt to his knees , and so upward , and upward , and all was as cold as any stone .

They say he cried out of sack .

Ay , that a' did .

And of women .

Nay , that a' did not .

Yes , that a' did ; and said they were devils incarnate .

A' could never abide carnation ; 'twas a colour he never liked .

A' said once , the devil would have him about women .

A' did in some sort , indeed , handle women ; but then he was rheumatic , and talked of the whore of Babylon .

Do you not remember a' saw a flea stick upon Bardolph's nose , and a' said it was a black soul burning in hell-fire ?

Well , the fuel is gone that maintained that fire : that's all the riches I got in his service .

Shall we shog , the king will be gone from Southampton .

Come , let's away . My love , give me thy lips .
Look to my chattels and my moveables :
Let senses rule , the word is , 'Pitch and pay ;' 
Trust none ;
For oaths are straws , men's faiths are wafercakes ,
And hold-fast is the only dog , my duck :
Therefore , caveto be thy counsellor .
Go , clear thy crystals . Yoke-fellows in arms ,
Let us to France ; like horse-leeches , my boys ,
To suck , to suck , the very blood to suck !

And that's but unwholesome food , they say .

Touch her soft mouth , and march .

Farewell , hostess .


I cannot kiss , that is the humour of it ; but , adieu .

Let housewifery appear : keep close , I thee command .

Farewell ; adieu .

Thus come the English with full power upon us ;
And more than carefully it us concerns 
To answer royally in our defences .
Therefore the Dukes of Berri and Britaine ,
Of Brabant and of Orleans , shall make forth ,
And you , Prince Dauphin , with all swift dispatch ,
To line and new repair our towns of war 
With men of courage and with means defendant :
For England his approaches makes as fierce 
As waters to the sucking of a gulf .
It fits us then to be as provident 
As fear may teach us , out of late examples 
Left by the fatal and neglected English 
Upon our fields .

My most redoubted father ,
It is most meet we arm us 'gainst the foe ;
For peace itself should not so dull a kingdom ,
Though war nor no known quarrel were in question ,
But that defences , musters , preparations ,
Should be maintain'd , assembled , and collected ,
As were a war in expectation .
Therefore , I say 'tis meet we all go forth 
To view the sick and feeble parts of France :
And let us do it with no show of fear ;
No , with no more than if we heard that England 
Were busied with a Whitsun morris-dance :
For , my good liege , she is so idly king'd ,
Her sceptre so fantastically borne 
By a vain , giddy , shallow , humorous youth ,
That fear attends her not .

O peace , Prince Dauphin !
You are too much mistaken in this king .
Question your Grace the late ambassadors ,
With what great state he heard their embassy ,
How well supplied with noble counsellors ,
How modest in exception , and , withal 
How terrible in constant resolution ,
And you shall find his vanities forespent 
Were but the outside of the Roman Brutus ,
Covering discretion with a coat of folly ;
As gardeners do with ordure hide those roots 
That shall first spring and be most delicate .

Well , 'tis not so , my lord high constable ;
But though we think it so , it is no matter :
In cases of defence 'tis best to weigh 
The enemy more mighty than he seems :
So the proportions of defence are fill'd ;
Which of a weak and niggardly projection 
Doth like a miser spoil his coat with scanting 
A little cloth .

Think we King Harry strong ;
And , princes , look you strongly arm to meet him .
The kindred of him hath been flesh'd upon us ,
And he is bred out of that bloody strain 
That haunted us in our familiar paths :
Witness our too much memorable shame 
When Cressy battle fatally was struck 
And all our princes captiv'd by the hand 
Of that black name , Edward Black Prince of Wales ;
Whiles that his mounting sire , on mountain standing ,
Up in the air , crown'd with the golden sun ,
Saw his heroical seed , and smil'd to see him 
Mangle the work of nature , and deface 
The patterns that by God and by French fathers 
Had twenty years been made . This is a stem 
Of that victorious stock ; and let us fear 
The native mightiness and fate of him .


Ambassadors from Harry King of England 
Do crave admittance to your majesty .

We'll give them present audience . Go , and bring them .

You see this chase is hotly follow'd , friends .

Turn head , and stop pursuit ; for coward dogs 
Most spend their mouths when what they seem to threaten 
Runs far before them . Good my sovereign ,
Take up the English short , and let them know 
Of what a monarchy you are the head :
Self-love , my liege , is not so vile a sin 
As self-neglecting .


From our brother England ?

From him ; and thus he greets your majesty .
He wills you , in the name of God Almighty ,
That you divest yourself , and lay apart 
The borrow'd glories that by gift of heaven ,
By law of nature and of nations 'long 
To him and to his heirs ; namely , the crown 
And all wide-stretched honours that pertain 
By custom and the ordinance of times 
Unto the crown of France . That you may know 
'Tis no sinister nor no awkward claim ,
Pick'd from the worm-holes of long-vanish'd days ,
Nor from the dust of old oblivion rak'd ,
He sends you this most memorable line ,

In every branch truly demonstrative ;
Willing you overlook this pedigree ;
And when you find him evenly deriv'd 
From his most fam'd of famous ancestors ,
Edward the Third , he bids you then resign 
Your crown and kingdom , indirectly held 
From him the native and true challenger .

Or else what follows ?

Bloody constraint ; for if you hide the crown 
Even in your hearts , there will he rake for it :
Therefore in fierce tempest is he coming ,
In thunder and in earthquake like a Jove ,
That , if requiring fail , he will compel ;
And bids you , in the bowels of the Lord ,
Deliver up the crown , and to take mercy 
On the poor souls for whom this hungry war 
Opens his vasty jaws ; and on your head 
Turning the widows' tears , the orphans' cries ,
The dead men's blood , the pining maidens' groans ,
For husbands , fathers , and betrothed lovers ,
That shall be swallow'd in this controversy .
This is his claim , his threat'ning , and my message ;
Unless the Dauphin be in presence here ,
To whom expressly I bring greeting too .

For us , we will consider of this further :
To-morrow shall you bear our full intent 
Back to our brother England .

For the Dauphin ,
I stand here for him : what to him from England ?

Scorn and defiance , slight regard , contempt ,
And anything that may not misbecome 
The mighty sender , doth he prize you at .
Thus says my king : an if your father's highness 
Do not , in grant of all demands at large ,
Sweeten the bitter mock you sent his majesty ,
He'll call you to so hot an answer of it ,
That caves and womby vaultages of France 
Shall chide your trespass and return your mock 
In second accent of his ordinance .

Say , if my father render fair return ,
It is against my will ; for I desire 
Nothing but odds with England : to that end ,
As matching to his youth and vanity ,
I did present him with the Paris balls .

He'll make your Paris Louvre shake for it ,
Were it the mistress-court of mighty Europe :
And , be assur'd , you'll find a difference 
As we his subjects have in wonder found 
Between the promise of his greener days 
And these he masters now . Now he weighs time 
Even to the utmost grain ; that you shall read 
In your own losses , if he stay in France .

To-morrow shall you know our mind at full .

Dispatch us with all speed , lest that our king 
Come here himself to question our delay ;
For he is footed in this land already .

You shall be soon dispatch'd with fair conditions :
A night is but small breath and little pause 
To answer matters of this consequence .

Thus with imagin'd wing our swift scene flies 
In motion of no less celerity 
Than that of thought . Suppose that you have seen 
The well-appointed king at Hampton pier 
Embark his royalty ; and his brave fleet 
With silken streamers the young Ph bus fanning :
Play with your fancies , and in them behold 
Upon the hempen tackle ship-boys climbing ;
Hear the shrill whistle which doth order give 
To sounds confus'd ; behold the threaden sails ,
Borne with the invisible and creeping wind ,
Draw the huge bottoms through the furrow'd sea ,
Breasting the lofty surge . O , do but think 
You stand upon the rivage and behold 
A city on the inconstant billows dancing ;
For so appears this fleet majestical ,
Holding due course to Harfleur . Follow , follow !
Grapple your minds to sternage of this navy ,
And leave your England , as dead midnight still ,
Guarded with grandsires , babies , and old women ,
Either past or not arriv'd to pith and puissance :
For who is he , whose chin is but enrich'd 
With one appearing hair , that will not follow 
Those call'd and choice-drawn cavaliers to France ?
Work , work your thoughts , and therein see a siege ;
Behold the ordenance on their carriages ,
With fatal mouths gaping on girded Harfleur .
Suppose the ambassador from the French comes back ;
Tells Harry that the king doth offer him 
Katharine his daughter ; and with her , to dowry ,
Some petty and unprofitable dukedoms :
The offer likes not : and the nimble gunner 
With linstock now the devilish cannon touches ,

And down goes all before them . Still be kind ,
And eke out our performance with your mind .

Once more unto the breach , dear friends , once more ;
Or close the wall up with our English dead !
In peace there's nothing so becomes a man 
As modest stillness and humility :
But when the blast of war blows in our ears ,
Then imitate the action of the tiger ;
Stiffen the sinews , summon up the blood ,
Disguise fair nature with hard-favour'd rage ;
Then lend the eye a terrible aspect ;
Let it pry through the portage of the head 
Like the brass cannon ; let the brow o'erwhelm it 
As fearfully as doth a galled rock 
O'erhang and jutty his confounded base ,
Swill'd with the wild and wasteful ocean .
Now set the teeth and stretch the nostril wide ,
Hold hard the breath , and bend up every spirit 
To his full height , On , on , you noblest English !
Whose blood is fet from fathers of war-proof ;
Fathers that , like so many Alexanders ,
Have in these parts from morn till even fought ,
And sheath'd their swords for lack of argument .
Dishonour not your mothers ; now attest 
That those whom you call'd fathers did beget you .
Be copy now to men of grosser blood ,
And teach them how to war . And you , good yeomen ,
Whose limbs were made in England , show us here 
The mettle of your pasture ; let us swear 
That you are worth your breeding ; which I doubt not ;
For there is none of you so mean and base 
That hath not noble lustre in your eyes .
I see you stand like greyhounds in the slips ,
Straining upon the start . The game's afoot :
Follow your spirit ; and , upon this charge 
Cry 'God for Harry , England and Saint George !' 


On , on , on , on , on , to the breach , to the breach !

Pray thee , corporal , stay : the knocks are too hot ; and for mine own part , I have not a case of lives : the humour of it is too hot , that is the very plain-song of it .

The plain-song is most just , for humours do abound :

Knocks go and come : God's vassals drop and die ;
And sword and shield 
In bloody field 
Doth win immortal fame .


Would I were in an alehouse in London , I would give all my fame for a pot of ale , and safety .

And I :

If wishes would prevail with me ,
My purpose should not fail with me ,
But thither would I hie .

As duly ,
But not as truly ,
As bird doth sing on bough .

Up to the breach , you dogs , avaunt , you cullions !


Be merciful , great duke , to men of mould !
Abate thy rage , abate thy manly rage !
Abate thy rage , great duke !
Good bawcock , bate thy rage ; use lenity , sweet chuck !

These be good humours , your honour wins bad humours .


As young as I am , I have observed these three swashers . I am boy to them all three , but all they three , though they would serve me , could not be man to me ; for , indeed three such antiques do not amount to a man . For Bardolph , he is white-livered and red-faced ; by the means whereof , a' faces it out , but fights not . For Pistol , he hath a killing tongue and a quiet sword ; by the means whereof a' breaks words , and keeps whole weapons . For Nym , he hath heard that men of few words are the best men ; and therefore he scorns to say his prayers , lest a' should be thought a coward : but his few bad words are matched with as few good deeds ; for a' never broke any man's head but his own , and that was against a post when he was drunk . They will steal any thing and call it purchase . Bardolph stole a lute-case , bore it twelve leagues , and sold it for three half-pence . Nym and Bardolph are sworn brothers in filching , and in Calais they stole a fire-shovel ;I knew by that piece of service the men would carry coals ,they would have me as familiar with men's pockets as their gloves or their handkerchers : which makes much against my manhood if I should take from another's pocket to put into mine ; for it is plain pocketing up of wrongs . I must leave them and seek some better service : their villany goes against my weak stomach , and therefore I must cast it up .

Captain Fluellen , you must come presently to the mines : the Duke of Gloucester would speak with you .

To the mines , tell you the duke it is not so good to come to the mines . For look you , the mines is not according to the disciplines of the war ; the concavities of it is not sufficient ; for , look you , th' athversary you may discuss unto the duke , look you is digt himself four yards under the countermines ; by Cheshu , I think , a' will plow up all if there is not better directions .

The Duke of Gloucester , to whom the order of the siege is given , is altogether directed by an Irishman , a very valiant gentleman , i' faith .

It is Captain Macmorris , is it not ?

I think it be .

By Cheshu , he is an ass , as in the world :
I will verify as much in his peard : he has no more directions in the true disciplines of the wars , look you , of the Roman disciplines , than is a puppy-dog .


Here a' comes ; and the Scots captain , Captain Jamy , with him .

Captain Jamy is a marvellous falorous gentleman , that is certain ; and of great expedition and knowledge in th' aunchient wars , upon my particular knowledge of his directions : by Cheshu , he will maintain his argument as well as any military man in the world , in the disciplines of the pristine wars of the Romans .

I say gud day , Captain Fluellen .

God-den to your worship , good Captain James .

How now , Captain Macmorris , have you quit the mines , have the pioners given o'er ?

By Chrish , la , tish ill done : the work ish give over , the trumpet sound the retreat . By my hand , I swear , and my father's soul , the work ish ill done ; it ish give over : I would have blowed up the town , so Chrish save me , la , in an hour : O , tish ill done , tish ill done ; by my hand , tish ill done !

Captain Macmorris , I beseech you now , will you voutsafe me , look you , a few disputations with you , as partly touching or concerning the disciplines of the war , the Roman wars , in the way of argument , look you , and friendly communication ; partly to satisfy my opinion , and partly for the satisfaction , look you , of my mind , as touching the direction of the military discipline : that is the point .

It sall be vary gud , gud feith , gud captains bath :

and I sall quit you with gud leve , as I may pick occasion ; that sall I , marry .

It is no time to discourse , so Chrish save me : the day is hot , and the weather , and the wars , and the king , and the dukes : it is no time to discourse . The town is beseeched , and the trumpet calls us to the breach ; and we talk , and be Chrish , do nothing : 'tis shame for us all ; so God sa' me , 'tis shame to stand still ; it is shame , by my hand ; and there is throats to be cut , and works to be done ; and there ish nothing done , so Chrish sa' me , la !

By the mess , ere theise eyes of mine take themselves to slumber , aile do gud service , or aile lig i' the grund for it ; ay , or go to death ; and aile pay it as valorously as I may , that sal I suerly do , that is the breff and the long . Marry , I wad full fain heard some question 'tween you tway .

Captain Macmorris , I think , look you , under your correction , there is not many of your nation 

Of my nation , What ish my nation , ish a villain , and a bastard , and a knave , and a rascal , What ish my nation , Who talks of my nation ?

Look you , if you take the matter otherwise than is meant , Captain Macmorris , peradventure I shall think you do not use me with that affability as in discretion you ought to use me , look you ; being as good a man as yourself , both in the disciplines of wars , and in the derivation of my birth , and in other particularities .

I do not know you so good a man as myself : so Chrish save me , I will cut off your head .

Gentlemen both , you will mistake each other .

A , that's a foul fault .


The town sounds a parley .

Captain Macmorris , when there is more better opportunity to be required , look you , I will be so bold as to tell you I know the disciplines of wars ; and there is an end .

How yet resolves the governor of the town ?
This is the latest parle we will admit :
Therefore to our best mercy give yourselves ;
Or like to men proud of destruction 
Defy us to our worst : for , as I am a soldier ,
A name that in my thoughts , becomes me best ,
If I begin the battery once again ,
I will not leave the half-achieved Harfleur 
Till in her ashes she lie buried .
The gates of mercy shall be all shut up ,
And the flesh'd soldier , rough and hard of heart ,
In liberty of bloody hand shall range 
With conscience wide as hell , mowing like grass 
Your fresh-fair virgins and your flowering infants .
What is it then to me , if impious war ,
Array'd in flames like to the prince of fiends ,
Do , with his smirch'd complexion , all fell feats 
Enlink'd to waste and desolation ?
What is't to me , when you yourselves are cause ,
If your pure maidens fall into the hand 
Of hot and forcing violation ?
What rein can hold licentious wickedness 
When down the hill he holds his fierce career ?
We may as bootless spend our vain command 
Upon the enraged soldiers in their spoil 
As send precepts to the leviathan 
To come ashore . Therefore , you men of Harfleur ,
Take pity of your town and of your people ,
Whiles yet my soldiers are in my command ;
Whiles yet the cool and temperate wind of grace 
O'erblows the filthy and contagious clouds 
Of heady murder , spoil , and villany .
If not , why , in a moment , look to see 
The blind and bloody soldier with foul hand 
Defile the locks of your shrill-shrieking daughters ;
Your fathers taken by the silver beards ,
And their most reverend heads dash'd to the walls ;
Your naked infants spitted upon pikes ,
Whiles the mad mothers with their howls confus'd 
Do break the clouds , as did the wives of Jewry 
At Herod's bloody-hunting slaughtermen .
What say you , will you yield , and this avoid ?
Or , guilty in defence , be thus destroy'd ?

Our expectation hath this day an end .
The Dauphin , whom of succour we entreated ,
Returns us that his powers are yet not ready 
To raise so great a siege . Therefore , great king ,
We yield our town and lives to thy soft mercy .
Enter our gates ; dispose of us and ours ;
For we no longer are defensible .

Open your gates , Come , uncle Exeter ,
Go you and enter Harfleur ; there remain ,
And fortify it strongly 'gainst the French :
Use mercy to them all . For us , dear uncle ,
The winter coming on and sickness growing 
Upon our soldiers , we will retire to Calais .
To-night in Harfleur will we be your guest ;
To-morrow for the march are we addrest .


Alice , tu as est  en Angleterre , et tu parles bien le langage .

Un peu , madame .

Je te prie , m'enseignez ; il faut que j'apprenne   parler . Comment appellez vous la main en Anglois ?

La main , elle est appell e , de hand .

De hand . Et les doigts ?

Les doigts , ma foy , je oublie les doigts ; mais je me souviendray . Les doigts , je pense qu'ils sont appell s de fingres ; ouy , de fingres .

La main , de hand ; les doigts , de fingres . Je pense que je suis le bon escolier . J'ai gagn  deux mots d'Anglois vistement . Comment appellez vous les ongles ?

Lesongles , nous les appellons , de nails .

De nails . Escoutez ; dites moy , si je parle bien : de hands , de fingres , et de nails .

C'est bien dict , madame ; il est fort bon Anglois .

Dites moy l'Anglois pour le bras .

De arm , madame .

Et le coude ?

De elbow .

De elbow . Je m'en fais la r p tition de tous les mots que vous m'avez appris d s   pr sent .

Il est trop difficile , madame , comme je pense .

Excusez moy , Alice ; escoutez : de hand , de fingres , de nails , de arma , de bilbow .

De elbow , madame .

O Seigneur Dieu , je m'en oublie ; de elbow . Comment appellez vous le col ?

De nick , madame .

De nick . Et le menton ?

De chin .

De sin . Le col , de nick : le menton , de sin .

Ouy . Sauf vostre honneur , en v rit  vous prononcez les mots aussi droict que les natifs d'Angleterre .

Je ne doute point d'apprendre par la grace de Dieu , et en peu de temps .

N'avez vous d j  oubli  ce que je vous ay enseign e ?

Non , je reciteray   vous promptement .
De hand , de fingre , de mails ,

De nails , madame .

De nails , de arme , de ilbow .

Sauf vostre honneur , d'elbow .

Ainsi dis je ; d'elbow , de nick , et de sin . Comment appellez vous le pied et la robe ?

De foot , madame ; et de coun .

De foot , et de coun , O Seigneur Dieu , ces sont mots de son mauvais , corruptible , gros , et impudique , et non pour les dames d'honneur d'user . Je ne voudrois prononcer ces mots devant les seigneurs de France , pour tout le monde . Foh , le foot , et le coun . N antmoins je reciterai une autre fois ma le on ensemble : de hand , de fingre , de nails , d'arm , d'elbow , de nick , de sin , de foot , de coun .

Excellent , madame !

C'est assez pour une fois : allons nous   diner .


'Tis certain , he hath pass'd the river Somme .

And if he be not fought withal , my lord ,
Let us not live in France ; let us quit all ,
And give our vineyards to a barbarous people .

O Dieu vivant , shall a few sprays of us ,
The emptying of our fathers' luxury ,
Our scions , put in wild and savage stock ,
Spirt up so suddenly into the clouds ,
And overlook their grafters ?

Normans , but bastard Normans , Norman bastards !
Mort de ma vie , if they march along 
Unfought withal , but I will sell my dukedom ,
To buy a slobbery and a dirty farm 
In that nook-shotten isle of Albion .

Dieu de battailes , where have they this mettle ?
Is not their climate foggy , raw , and dull ,
On whom , as in despite , the sun looks pale ,
Killing their fruit with frowns , Can sodden water ,
A drench for sur-rein'd jades , their barley-broth ,
Decoct their cold blood to such valiant heat ?
And shall our quick blood , spirited with wine ,
Seem frosty , O , for honour of our land ,
Let us not hang like roping icicles 
Upon our houses' thatch , whiles a more frosty people 
Sweat drops of gallant youth in our rich fields ;
Poor we may call them in their native lords .

By faith and honour ,
Our madams mock at us , and plainly say 
Our mettle is bred out ; and they will give 
Their bodies to the lust of English youth 
To new-store France with bastard warriors .

They bid us to the English dancing-schools ,
And teach lavoltas high and swift corantos ;
Saying our grace is only in our heels ,
And that we are most lofty runaways .

Where is Montjoy the herald , speed him hence :
Let him greet England with our sharp defiance .
Up , princes , and , with spirit of honour edg'd 
More sharper than your swords , hie to the field :
Charles Delabreth , High Constable of France ;
You Dukes of Orleans , Bourbon , and Berri ,
Alen on , Brabant , Bar , and Burgundy ;
Jaques Chatillon , Rambures , Vaudemont ,
Beaumont , Grandpr , Roussi , and Fauconberg ,
Foix , Lestrale , Bouciqualt , and Charolois ;
High dukes , great princes , barons , lords , and knights ,
For your great seats now quit you of great shames .
Bar Harry England , that sweeps through our land 
With pennons painted in the blood of Harfleur :
Rush on his host , as doth the melted snow 
Upon the valleys , whose low vassal seat 
The Alps doth spit and void his rheum upon :
Go down upon him , you have power enough ,
And in a captive chariot into Roan 
Bring him our prisoner .

This becomes the great .
Sorry am I his numbers are so few ,
His soldiers sick and famish'd in their march ,
For I am sure when he shall see our army 
He'll drop his heart into the sink of fear ,
And for achievement offer us his ransom .

Therefore , lord constable , haste on Montjoy ,
And let him say to England that we send 
To know what willing ransom he will give .
Prince Dauphin , you shall stay with us in Roan .

Not so , I do beseech your majesty .

Be patient , for you shall remain with us .
Now forth , lord constable and princes all ,
And quickly bring us word of England's fall .


How now , Captain Fluellen , come you from the bridge ?

I assure you , there is very excellent services committed at the pridge .

Is the Duke of Exeter safe ?

The Duke of Exeter is as magnanimous as Agamemnon ; and a man that I love and honour with my soul , and my heart , and my duty , and my life , and my living , and my uttermost power : he is not God be praised and plessed !any hurt in the world ; but keeps the pridge most valiantly , with excellent discipline . There is an aunchient lieutenant there at the pridge , I think , in my very conscience , he is as valiant a man as Mark Antony ; and he is a man of no estimation in the world ; but I did see him do as gallant service .

What do you call him ?

He is called Aunchient Pistol .

I know him not .


Here is the man .

Captain , I thee beseech to do me favours :
The Duke of Exeter doth love thee well .

Ay , I praise God ; and I have merited some love at his hands .

Bardolph , a soldier firm and sound of heart ,
And of buxom valour , hath , by cruel fate 
And giddy Fortune's furious fickle wheel ,
That goddess blind ,
That stands upon the rolling restless stone ,

By your patience , Aunchient Pistol . Fortune is painted plind , with a muffler afore her eyes , to signify to you that Fortune is plind : and she is painted also with a wheel , to signify to you , which is the moral of it , that she is turning , and inconstant , and mutability , and variation : and her foot , look you , is fixed upon a spherical stone , which rolls , and rolls , and rolls : in good truth , the poet makes a most excellent description of it : Fortune is an excellent moral .

Fortune is Bardolph's foe , and frowns on him ;
For he hath stol'n a pax , and hanged must a' be ,
A damned death !
Let gallows gape for dog , let man go free 
And let not hemp his wind-pipe suffocate .
But Exeter hath given the doom of death 
For pax of little price .
Therefore , go speak ; the duke will hear thy voice ;
And let not Bardolph's vital thread be cut 
With edge of penny cord and vile reproach :
Speak , captain , for his life , and I will thee requite .

Aunchient Pistol , I do partly understand your meaning .

Why then , rejoice therefore .

Certainly , aunchient , it is not a thing to rejoice at ; for , if , look you , he were my brother , I would desire the duke to use his good pleasure and put him to execution ; for discipline ought to be used .

Die and be damn'd ; and figo for thy friendship !

It is well .

The fig of Spain !


Very good .

Why , this is an arrant counterfeit rascal : I remember him now ; a bawd , a cutpurse .

I'll assure you a' uttered as prave words at the pridge as you shall see in a summer's day . But it is very well ; what he has spoke to me , that is well , I warrant you , when time is serve .

Why , 'tis a gull , a fool , a rogue , that now and then goes to the wars to grace himself at his return into London under the form of a soldier . And such fellows are perfect in the great commanders' names , and they will learn you by rote where services were done ; at such and such a sconce , at such a breach , at such a convoy ; who came off bravely , who was shot , who disgraced , what terms the enemy stood on ; and this they con perfectly in the phrase of war , which they trick up with new-tuned oaths : and what a beard of the general's cut and a horrid suit of the camp will do among foaming bottles and ale-washed wits , is wonderful to be thought on . But you must learn to know such slanders of the age , or else you may be marvellously mistook .

I tell you what , Captain Gower ; I do perceive , he is not the man that he would gladly make show to the world he is : if I find a hole in his coat I will tell him my mind .

Hark you , the king is coming ; and I must speak with him from the pridgo .


God pless your majesty !

How now , Fluellen , cam'st thou from the bridge ?

Ay , so please your majesty . The Duke of Exeter hath very gallantly maintained the pridge : the French is gone off , look you , and there is gallant and most prave passages . Marry , th' athversary was have possession of the pridge , but he is enforced to retire , and the Duke of Exeter is master of the pridge . I can tell your majesty the duke is a prave man .

What men have you lost , Fluellen ?

The perdition of th' athversary hath been very great , reasonable great : marry , for my part , I think the duke hath lost never a man but one that is like to be executed for robbing a church ; one Bardolph , if your majesty know the man : his face is all bubukles , and whelks , and knobs , and flames o' fire ; and his lips blows at his nose , and it is like a coal of fire , sometimes plue and sometimes red ; but his nose is executed , and his fire's out .

We would have all such offenders so cut off : and we give express charge that in our marches through the country there be nothing compelled from the villages , nothing taken but paid for , none of the French upbraided or abused in disdainful language ; for when lenity and cruelty play for a kingdom , the gentler gamester is the soonest winner .


You know me by my habit .

Well then I know thee : what shall I know of thee ?

My master's mind .

Unfold it .

Thus says my king : Say thou to Harry of England : Though we seemed dead , we did but sleep : advantage is a better soldier than rashness . Tell him , we could have rebuked him at Harfleur , but that we thought not good to bruise an injury till it were full ripe : now we speak upon our cue , and our voice is imperial : England shall repent his folly , see his weakness , and admire our sufferance . Bid him therefore consider of his ransom ; which must proportion the losses we have borne , the subjects we have lost , the disgrace we have digested ; which , in weight to re-answer , his pettiness would bow under . For our losses , his exchequer is too poor ; for the effusion of our blood , the muster of his kingdom too faint a number ; and for our disgrace , his own person , kneeling at our feet , but a weak and worthless satisfaction . To this add defiance : and tell him , for conclusion , he hath betrayed his followers , whose condemnation is pronounced . So far my king and master , so much my office .

What is thy name , I know thy quality .

Montjoy .

Thou dost thy office fairly . Turn thee back ,
And tell thy king I do not seek him now ,
But could be willing to march on to Calais 
Without impeachment ; for , to say the sooth ,
Though 'tis no wisdom to confess so much 
Unto an enemy of craft and vantage ,
My people are with sickness much enfeebled ,
My numbers lessen'd , and those few I have 
Almost no better than so many French :
Who , when they were in health , I tell thee , herald ,
I thought upon one pair of English legs 
Did march three Frenchmen . Yet , forgive me , God ,
That I do brag thus , this your air of France 
Hath blown that vice in me ; I must repent .
Go therefore , tell thy master here I am :
My ransom is this frail and worthless trunk ,
My army but a weak and sickly guard ;
Yet , God before , tell him we will come on ,
Though France himself and such another neighbour 
Stand in our way . There's for thy labour , Montjoy .
Go , bid thy master well advise himself :
If we may pass , we will ; if we be hinder'd ,
We shall your tawny ground with your red blood 
Discolour : and so , Montjoy , fare you well .
The sum of all our answer is but this :
We would not seek a battle as we are ;
Nor , as we are , we say we will not shun it :
So tell your master .

I shall deliver so . Thanks to your highness .


I hope they will not come upon us now .

We are in God's hand , brother , not in theirs .
March to the bridge ; it now draws toward night :
Beyond the river we'll encamp ourselves ,
And on to-morrow bid them march away .


Tut , I have the best armour of the world . Would it were day !

You have an excellent armour ; but let my horse have his due .

It is the best horse of Europe .

Will it never be morning ?

My Lord of Orleans , and my lord high constable , you talk of horse and armour 

You are as well provided of both as any prince in the world .

What a long night is this , I will not change my horse with any that treads but on four pasterns .  a , ha , He bounds from the earth as if his entrails were hairs : le cheval volant , the Pegasus , qui a les narines de feu , When I bestride him , I soar , I am a hawk : he trots the air ; the earth sings when he touches it ; the basest horn of his hoof is more musical than the pipe of Hermes .

He's of the colour of the nutmeg .

And of the heat of the ginger . It is a beast for Perseus : he is pure air and fire ; and the dull elements of earth and water never appear in him but only in patient stillness while his rider mounts him : he is indeed a horse ; and all other jades you may call beasts .

Indeed , my lord , it is a most absolute and excellent horse .

It is the prince of palfreys ; his neigh is like the bidding of a monarch and his countenance enforces homage .

No more , cousin .

Nay , the man hath no wit that cannot , from the rising of the lark to the lodging of the lamb , vary deserved praise on my palfrey : it is a theme as fluent as the sea ; turn the sands into eloquent tongues , and my horse is argument for them all . 'Tis a subject for a sovereign to reason on , and for a sovereign's sovereign to ride on ; and for the world familiar to us , and unknown to lay apart their particular functions and wonder at him . I once writ a sonnet in his praise and began thus : 'Wonder of nature !' 

I have heard a sonnet begin so to one's mistress .

Then did they imitate that which I composed to my courser ; for my horse is my mistress .

Your mistress bears well .

Me well ; which is the prescript praise and perfection of a good and particular mistress .

Ma foi , methought yesterday your mistress shrewdly shook your back .

So perhaps did yours .

Mine was not bridled .

O , then belike she was old and gentle ; and you rode , like a kern of Ireland , your French hose off and in your straight strossers .

You have good judgment in horsemanship .

Be warned by me , then : they that ride so , and ride not warily , fall into foul bogs . I had rather have my horse to my mistress .

I had as lief have my mistress a jade .

I tell thee , constable , my mistress wears his own hair .

I could make as true a boast as that if I had a sow to my mistress .

Le chien est retourn    son propre vomissement , et la truie lav e au bourbier : thou makest use of any thing .

Yet do I not use my horse for my mistress : or any such proverb so little kin to the purpose .

My lord constable , the armour that I saw in your tent to-night , are those stars or suns upon it ?

Stars , my lord .

Some of them will fall to-morrow , I hope .

And yet my sky shall not want .

That may be , for you bear a many superfluously , and 'twere more honour some were away .

Even as your horse bears your praises ; who would trot as well were some of your brags dismounted .

Would I were able to load him with his desert , Will it never be day , I will trot to-morrow a mile , and my way shall be paved with English faces .

I will not say so for fear I should be faced out of my way . But I would it were morning , for I would fain be about the ears of the English .

Who will go to hazard with me for twenty prisoners ?

You must first go yourself to hazard , ere you have them .

'Tis midnight : I'll go arm myself .


The Dauphin longs for morning .

He longs to eat the English .

I think he will eat all he kills .

By the white hand of my lady , he's a gallant prince .

Swear by her foot , that she may tread out the oath .

He is simply the most active gentleman of France .

Doing is activity , and he will still be doing .

He never did harm , that I heard of .

Nor will do none to-morrow : he will keep that good name still .

I know him to be valiant .

I was told that by one that knows him better than you .

What's he ?

Marry , he told me so himself ; and he said he cared not who knew it .

He needs not ; it is no hidden virtue in him .

By my faith , sir , but it is ; never any body saw it but his lackey : 'tis a hooded valour ; and when it appears , it will bate .

'Ill will never said well .' 

I will cap that proverb with 'There is flattery in friendship .' 

And I will take up that with 'Give the devil his due .' 

Well placed : there stands your friend for the devil : have at the very eye of that proverb , with 'A pox of the devil .' 

You are the better at proverbs , by how much 'A fool's bolt is soon shot .' 

You have shot over .

'Tis not the first time you were overshot .


My lord high constable , the English lie within fifteen hundred paces of your tents .

Who hath measured the ground ?

The Lord Grandpr .

A valiant and most expert gentleman . Would it were day , Alas , poor Harry of England , he longs not for the dawning as we do .

What a wretched and peevish fellow is this King of England , to mope with his fatbrained followers so far out of his knowledge !

If the English had any apprehension they would run away .

That they lack ; for if their heads had any intellectual armour they could never wear such heavy head-pieces .

That island of England breeds very valiant creatures : their mastiffs are of unmatchable courage .

Foolish curs , that run winking into the mouth of a Russian bear and have their heads crushed like rotten apples . You may as well say that's a valiant flea that dare eat his breakfast on the lip of a lion .

Just , just ; and the men do sympathize with the mastiffs in robustious and rough coming on , leaving their wits with their wives : and then give them great meals of beef and iron and steel , they will eat like wolves and fight like devils .

Ay , but these English are shrewdly out of beef .

Then shall we find to-morrow they have only stomachs to eat and none to fight . Now is it time to arm ; come , shall we about it ?

It is now two o'clock : but , let me see , by ten 
We shall have each a hundred Englishmen .


Now entertain conjecture of a time 
When creeping murmur and the poring dark 
Fills the wide vessel of the universe .
From camp to camp , through the foul womb of night ,
The hum of either army stilly sounds ,
That the fix'd sentinels almost receive 
The secret whispers of each other's watch :
Fire answers fire , and through their paly flames 
Each battle sees the other's umber'd face :
Steed threatens steed , in high and boastful neighs 
Piercing the night's dull ear ; and from the tents 
The armourers , accomplishing the knights ,
With busy hammers closing rivets up ,
Give dreadful note of preparation .
The country cocks do crow , the clocks do toll ,
And the third hour of drowsy morning name .
Proud of their numbers , and secure in soul ,
The confident and over-lusty French 
Do the low-rated English play at dice ;
And chide the cripple tardy-gaited night 
Who , like a foul and ugly witch , doth limp 
So tediously away . The poor condemned English ,
Like sacrifices , by their watchful fires 
Sit patiently , and inly ruminate 
The morning's danger , and their gesture sad 
Investing lank-lean cheeks and war-worn coats 
Presenteth them unto the gazing moon 
So many horrid ghosts . O , now , who will behold 
The royal captain of this ruin'd band 
Walking from watch to watch , from tent to tent ,
Let him cry 'Praise and glory on his head !' 
For forth he goes and visits all his host ,
Bids them good morrow with a modest smile ,
And calls them brothers , friends , and countrymen .
Upon his royal face there is no note 
How dread an army hath enrounded him ;
Nor doth he dedicate one jot of colour 
Unto the weary and all-watched night :
But freshly looks and overbears attaint 
With cheerful semblance and sweet majesty ;
That every wretch , pining and pale before ,
Beholding him , plucks comfort from his looks ,
A largess universal , like the sun 
His liberal eye doth give to every one ,
Thawing cold fear . Then mean and gentle all ,
Behold , as may unworthiness define ,
A little touch of Harry in the night .
And so our scene must to the battle fly ;
Where ,O for pity ,we shall much disgrace ,
With four or five most vile and ragged foils ,
Right ill dispos'd in brawl ridiculous ,
The name of Agincourt . Yet sit and see ;
Minding true things by what their mockeries be .

Gloucester , 'tis true that we are in great danger ;
The greater therefore should our courage be .
Good morrow , brother Bedford . God Almighty !
There is some soul of goodness in things evil ,
Would men observingly distil it out ;
For our bad neighbour makes us early stirrers ,
Which is both healthful , and good husbandry :
Besides , they are our outward consciences ,
And preachers to us all ; admonishing 
That we should dress us fairly for our end .
Thus may we gather honey from the weed ,
And make a moral of the devil himself .


Good morrow , old Sir Thomas Erpingham :
A good soft pillow for that good white head 

Were better than a churlish turf of France .

Not so , my liege : this lodging likes me better ,
Since I may say , 'Now lie I like a king .' 

'Tis good for men to love their present pains 
Upon example ; so the spirit is eas'd :
And when the mind is quicken'd , out of doubt ,
The organs , though defunct and dead before ,
Break up their drowsy grave , and newly move 
With casted slough and fresh legerity .
Lend me thy cloak , Sir Thomas . Brothers both ,
Commend me to the princes in our camp ;
Do my good morrow to them ; and anon 
Desire them all to my pavilion .

We shall , my liege .


Shall I attend your Grace ?

No , my good knight ;
Go with my brothers to my lords of England :
I and my bosom must debate awhile ,
And then I would no other company .

The Lord in heaven bless thee , noble Harry !


God-a-mercy , old heart , thou speak'st cheerfully .


Qui va l ?

A friend .

Discuss unto me ; art thou officer ?
Or art thou base , common and popular ?

I am a gentleman of a company .

Trail'st thou the puissant pike ?

Even so . What are you ?

As good a gentleman as the emperor .

Then you are a better than the king .

The king's a bawcock , and a heart of gold ,
A lad of life , an imp of fame :
Of parents good , of fist most valiant :
I kiss his dirty shoe , and from my heart-string 
I love the lovely bully . What's thy name ?

Harry le Roy .

Le Roy , a Cornish name : art thou of Cornish crew ?

No , I am a Welshman .

Know'st thou Fluellen ?

Yes .

Tell him , I'll knock his leek about his pate 
Upon Saint Davy's day .

Do not you wear your dagger in your cap that day , lest he knock that about yours .

Art thou his friend ?

And his kinsman too .

The figo for thee then !

I thank you . God be with you !

My name is Pistol called .


It sorts well with your fierceness .

Captain Fluellen !

Sol in the name of Cheshu Christ , speak lower . It is the greatest admiration in the universal world , when the true and auncient prerogatifes and laws of the wars is not kept . If you would take the pains but to examine the wars of Pompey the Great , you shall find , I warrant you , that there is no tiddle-taddle nor pibble-pabble in Pompey's camp ; I warrant you , you shall find the ceremonies of the wars , and the cares of it , and the forms of it , and the sobriety of it , and the modesty of it , to be otherwise .

Why , the enemy is loud ; you heard him all night .

If the enemy is an ass and a fool and a prating coxcomb , is it meet , think you , that we should also , look you , be an ass and a fool and a prating coxcomb , in your own conscience now ?

I will speak lower .

I pray you and peseech you that you will .


Though it appear a little out of fashion ,
There is much care and valour in this Welshman .


Brother John Bates , is not that the morning which breaks yonder ?

I think it be ; but we have no great cause to desire the approach of day .

We see yonder the beginning of the day , but I think we shall never see the end of it . Who goes there ?

A friend .

Under what captain serve you ?

Under Sir Thomas Erpingham .

A good old commander and a most kind gentleman : I pray you , what thinks he of our estate ?

Even as men wracked upon a sand , that look to be washed off the next tide .

He hath not told his thought to the king ?

No ; nor it is not meet he should . For , though I speak it to you , I think the king is but a man , as I am : the violet smells to him as it doth to me ; the element shows to him as it doth to me ; all his senses have but human conditions : his ceremonies laid by , in his nakedness he appears but a man ; and though his affections are higher mounted than ours , yet when they stoop , they stoop with the like wing . Therefore when he sees reason of fears , as we do , his fears , out of doubt , be of the same relish as ours are : yet , in reason , no man should possess him with any appearance of fear , lest he , by showing it , should dishearten his army .

He may show what outward courage he will , but I believe , as cold a night as 'tis , he could wish himself in Thames up to the neck , and so I would he were , and I by him , at all adventures , so we were quit here .

By my troth , I will speak my conscience of the king : I think he would not wish himself any where but where he is .

Then I would he were here alone ; so should he be sure to be ransomed , and a many poor men's lives saved .

I dare say you love him not so ill to wish him here alone , howsoever you speak this to feel other men's minds . Methinks I could not die any where so contented as in the king's company , his cause being just and his quarrel honourable .

That's more than we know .

Ay , or more than we should seek after ; for we know enough if we know we are the king's subjects . If his cause be wrong , our obedience to the king wipes the crime of it out of us .

But if the cause be not good , the king himself hath a heavy reckoning to make ; when all those legs and arms and heads , chopped off in a battle , shall join together at the latter day , and cry all , 'We died at such a place ;' some swearing , some crying for a surgeon , some upon their wives left poor behind them , some upon the debts they owe , some upon their children rawly left . I am afeard there are few die well that die in a battle ; for how can they charitably dispose of any thing when blood is their argument , Now , if these men do not die well , it will be a black matter for the king that led them to it , whom to disobey were against all proportion of subjection .

So , if a son that is by his father sent about merchandise do sinfully miscarry upon the sea , the imputation of his wickedness , by your rule , should be imposed upon his father that sent him : or if a servant , under his master's command transporting a sum of money , be assailed by robbers and die in many irreconciled iniquities , you may call the business of the master the author of the servant's damnation . But this is not so : the king is not bound to answer the particular endings of his soldiers , the father of his son , nor the master of his servant ; for they purpose not their death when they purpose their services . Besides , there is no king , be his cause never so spotless , if it come to the arbitrement of swords , can try it out with all unspotted soldiers . Some , peradventure , have on them the guilt of premeditated and contrived murder ; some , of beguiling virgins with the broken seals of perjury ; some , making the wars their bulwark , that have before gored the gentle bosom of peace with pillage and robbery . Now , if these men have defeated the law and outrun native punishment , though they can outstrip men , they have no wings to fly from God : war is his beadle , war is his vengeance ; so that here men are punished for before-breach of the king's laws in now the king's quarrel : where they feared the death they have borne life away , and where they would be safe they perish . Then , if they die unprovided , no more is the king guilty of their damnation than he was before guilty of those impieties for the which they are now visited . Every subject's duty is the king's ; but every subject's soul is his own . Therefore should every soldier in the wars do as every sick man in his bed , wash every mote out of his conscience ; and dying so , death is to him advantage ; or not dying , the time was blessedly lost wherein such preparation was gained : and in him that escapes , it were not sin to think , that making God so free an offer , he let him outlive that day to see his greatness , and to teach others how they should prepare .

'Tis certain , every man that dies ill , the ill upon his own head : the king is not to answer it .

I do not desire he should answer for me ; and yet I determine to fight lustily for him .

I myself heard the king say he would not be ransomed .

Ay , he said so , to make us fight cheerfully ; but when our throats are cut he may be ransomed , and we ne'er the wiser .

If I live to see it , I will never trust his word after .

You pay him then . That's a perilous shot out of an elder-gun , that a poor and a private displeasure can do against a monarch . You may as well go about to turn the sun to ice with fanning in his face with a peacock's feather . You'll never trust his word after , come , 'tis a foolish saying .

Your reproof is something too round ; I should be angry with you if the time were convenient .

Let it be a quarrel between us , if you live .

I embrace it .

How shall I know thee again ?

Give me any gage of thine , and I will wear it in my bonnet : then , if ever thou darest acknowledge it , I will make it my quarrel .

Here's my glove : give me another of thine .

There .

This will I also wear in my cap : if ever thou come to me and say after to-morrow , 'This is my glove ,' by this hand I will take thee a box on the ear .

If ever I live to see it , I will challenge it .

Thou darest as well be hanged .

Well , I will do it , though I take thee in the king's company .

Keep thy word : fare thee well .

Be friends , you English fools , be friends : we have French quarrels enow , if you could tell how to reckon .

Indeed , the French may lay twenty French crowns to one , they will beat us ; for they bear them on their shoulders : but it is no English treason to cut French crowns , and to-morrow the king himself will be a clipper .

Upon the king , let us our lives , our souls ,
Our debts , our careful wives ,
Our children , and our sins lay on the king !
We must bear all . O hard condition !
Twin-born with greatness , subject to the breath 
Of every fool , whose sense no more can feel 
But his own wringing . What infinite heart's ease 
Must kings neglect that private men enjoy !
And what have kings that privates have not too ,
Save ceremony , save general ceremony ?
And what art thou , thou idle ceremony ?
What kind of god art thou , that suffer'st more 
Of mortal griefs than do thy worshippers ?
What are thy rents , what are thy comings-in ?
O ceremony , show me but thy worth :
What is thy soul of adoration ?
Art thou aught else but place , degree , and form ,
Creating awe and fear in other men ?
Wherein thou art less happy , being fear'd ,
Than they in fearing .
What drink'st thou oft , instead of homage sweet ,
But poison'd flattery , O , be sick , great greatness ,
And bid thy ceremony give thee cure .
Think'st thou the fiery fever will go out 
With titles blown from adulation ?
Will it give place to flexure and low-bending ?
Canst thou , when thou command'st the beggar's knee ,
Command the health of it , No , thou proud dream ,
That play'st so subtly with a king's repose ;
I am a king that find thee ; and I know 
'Tis not the balm , the sceptre and the ball ,
The sword , the mace , the crown imperial ,
The intertissued robe of gold and pearl ,
The farced title running 'fore the king ,
The throne he sits on , nor the tide of pomp 
That beats upon the high shore of this world ,
No , not all these , thrice-gorgeous ceremony ,
Not all these , laid in bed majestical ,
Can sleep so soundly as the wretched slave ,
Who with a body fill'd and vacant mind 
Gets him to rest , cramm'd with distressful bread ;
Never sees horrid night , the child of hell ,
But , like a lackey , from the rise to set 
Sweats in the eye of Ph bus , and all night 
Sleeps in Elysium ; next day after dawn ,
Doth rise and help Hyperion to his horse ,
And follows so the ever-running year 
With profitable labour to his grave :
And , but for ceremony , such a wretch ,
Winding up days with toil and nights with sleep ,
Had the fore-hand and vantage of a king .
The slave , a member of the country's peace ,
Enjoys it ; but in gross brain little wots 
What watch the king keeps to maintain the peace ,
Whose hours the peasant best advantages .


My lord , your nobles , jealous of your absence ,
Seek through your camp to find you .

Good old knight ,
Collect them all together at my tent :
I'll be before thee .

I shall do't , my lord .


O God of battles , steel my soldiers' hearts ;
Possess them not with fear ; take from them now 
The sense of reckoning , if the opposed numbers 
Pluck their hearts from them . Not to-day , O Lord !
O , not to-day , think not upon the fault 
My father made in compassing the crown .
I Richard's body have interr'd anew ,
And on it have bestow'd more contrite tears 
Than from it issu'd forced drops of blood .
Five hundred poor I have in yearly pay ,
Who twice a day their wither'd hands hold up 
Toward heaven , to pardon blood ; and I have built 
Two chantries , where the sad and solemn priests 
Sing still for Richard's soul . More will I do ;
Though all that I can do is nothing worth ,
Since that my penitence comes after all ,
Imploring pardon .


My liege !

My brother Gloucester's voice , Ay ;
I know thy errand , I will go with thee :
The day , my friends , and all things stay for me .


The sun doth gild our armour : up , my lords !

Montez   cheval , My horse , varlet , lacquais , ha !

O brave spirit !

Via , les eaux et la terre !

Rien puis , l'air et le feu .

Ciel , cousin Orleans .

Now , my lord constable !

Hark how our steeds for present service neigh !

Mount them , and make incision in their hides ,
That their hot blood may spin in English eyes ,
And dout them with superfluous courage : ha !

What , will you have them weep our horses' blood ?
How shall we then behold their natural tears ?


The English are embattail'd , you French peers .

To horse , you gallant princes , straight to horse !
Do but behold yon poor and starved band ,
And your fair show shall suck away their souls ,
Leaving them but the shales and husks of men .
There is not work enough for all our hands ;
Scarce blood enough in all their sickly veins 
To give each naked curtal-axe a stain ,
That our French gallants shall to-day draw out ,
And sheathe for lack of sport : let us but blow on them ,
The vapour of our valour will o'erturn them .
'Tis positive 'gainst all exceptions , lords ,
That our superfluous lackeys and our peasants ,
Who in unnecessary action swarm 
About our squares of battle , were enow 
To purge this field of such a hilding foe ,
Though we upon this mountain's basis by 
Took stand for idle speculation :
But that our honours must not . What's to say ?
A very little little let us do ,
And all is done . Then let the trumpets sound 
The tucket sonance and the note to mount :
For our approach shall so much dare the field ,
That England shall couch down in fear and yield .


Why do you stay so long , my lords of France ?
Yon island carrions desperate of their bones ,
Ill-favour'dly become the morning field :
Their ragged curtains poorly are let loose ,
And our air shakes them passing scornfully :
Big Mars seems bankrupt in their beggar'd host ,
And faintly through a rusty beaver peeps :
The horsemen sit like fixed candlesticks ,
With torch-staves in their hand ; and their poor jades 
Lob down their heads , dropping the hides and hips ,
The gum down-roping from their pale-dead eyes ,
And in their pale dull mouths the gimmal bit 
Lies foul with chew'd grass , still and motionless ;
And their executors , the knavish crows ,
Fly o'er them , all impatient for their hour .
Description cannot suit itself in words 
To demonstrate the life of such a battle 
In life so lifeless as it shows itself .

They have said their prayers , and they stay for death .

Shall we go send them dinners and fresh suits ,
And give their fasting horses provender ,
And after fight with them ?

I stay but for my guard : on , to the field !
I will the banner from a trumpet take ,
And use it for my haste . Come , come , away !
The sun is high , and we outwear the day .


Where is the king ?

The king himself is rode to view their battle .

Of fighting men they have full three-score thousand .

There's five to one ; besides , they all are fresh .

God's arm strike with us , 'tis a fearful odds .
God be wi' you , princes all ; I'll to my charge :
If we no more meet till we meet in heaven ,
Then , joyfully , my noble Lord of Bedford ,
My dear Lord Gloucester , and my good Lord Exeter ,
And my kind kinsman , warriors all , adieu !

Farewell , good Salisbury ; and good luck go with thee !

Farewell , kind lord . Fight valiantly to-day :
And yet I do thee wrong to mind thee of it ,
For thou art fram'd of the firm truth of valour .


He is as full of valour as of kindness ;
Princely in both .


O , that we now had here 
But one ten thousand of those men in England 
That do no work to-day .

What's he that wishes so ?
My cousin Westmoreland , No , my fair cousin :
If we are mark'd to die , we are enow 
To do our country loss ; and if to live ,
The fewer men , the greater share of honour .
God's will , I pray thee , wish not one man more .
By Jove , I am not covetous for gold ,
Nor care I who doth feed upon my cost ;
It yearns me not if men my garments wear ;
Such outward things dwell not in my desires :
But if it be a sin to covet honour ,
I am the most offending soul alive .
No , faith , my coz , wish not a man from England :
God's peace , I would not lose so great an honour 
As one man more , methinks , would share from me ,
For the best hope I have . O , do not wish one more :
Rather proclaim it , Westmoreland , through my host ,
That he which hath no stomach to this fight ,
Let him depart ; his passport shall be made ,
And crowns for convoy put into his purse :
We would not die in that man's company 
That fears his fellowship to die with us .
This day is call'd the feast of Crispian :
He that outlives this day , and comes safe home ,
Will stand a tip-toe when this day is nam'd ,
And rouse him at the name of Crispian .
He that shall live this day , and see old age ,
Will yearly on the vigil feast his neighbours ,
And say , 'To-morrow is Saint Crispian :' 
Then will he strip his sleeve and show his scars ,
And say , 'These wounds I had on Crispin's day .' 
Old men forget : yet all shall be forgot ,
But he'll remember with advantages 
What feats he did that day . Then shall our names ,
Familiar in his mouth as household words ,
Harry the king , Bedford and Exeter ,
Warwick and Talbot , Salisbury and Gloucester ,
Be in their flowing cups freshly remember'd .
This story shall the good man teach his son ;
And Crispin Crispian shall ne'er go by ,
From this day to the ending of the world ,
But we in it shall be remembered ;
We few , we happy few , we band of brothers ;
For he to-day that sheds his blood with me 
Shall be my brother ; be he ne'er so vile 
This day shall gentle his condition :
And gentlemen in England , now a-bed 
Shall think themselves accurs'd they were not here ,
And hold their manhoods cheap whiles any speaks 
That fought with us upon Saint Crispin's day .


My sov'reign lord , bestow yourself with speed :
The French are bravely in their battles set ,
And will with all expedience charge on us .

All things are ready , if our minds be so .

Perish the man whose mind is backward now !

Thou dost not wish more help from England , coz ?

God's will , my liege , would you and I alone ,
Without more help , could fight this royal battle !

Why , now thou hast unwish'd five thousand men ;
Which likes me better than to wish us one .
You know your places : God be with you all !


Once more I come to know of thee , King Harry ,
If for thy ransom thou wilt now compound ,
Before thy most assured overthrow :
For certainly thou art so near the gulf 
Thou needs must be englutted . Besides , in mercy ,
The constable desires thee thou wilt mind 
Thy followers of repentance ; that their souls 
May make a peaceful and a sweet retire 
From off these fields , where , wretches , their poor bodies 
Must lie and fester .

Who hath sent thee now ?

The Constable of France .

I pray thee , bear my former answer back :
Bid them achieve me and then sell my bones .
Good God , why should they mock poor fellows thus ?
The man that once did sell the lion's skin 
While the beast liv'd , was kill'd with hunting him .
A many of our bodies shall no doubt 
Find native graves ; upon the which , I trust ,
Shall witness live in brass of this day's work ;
And those that leave their valiant bones in France ,
Dying like men , though buried in your dung-hills ,
They shall be fam'd ; for there the sun shall greet them ,
And draw their honours reeking up to heaven ,
Leaving their earthly parts to choke your clime ,
The smell whereof shall breed a plague in France .
Mark then abounding valour in our English ,
That being dead , like to the bullet's grazing ,
Break out into a second course of mischief ,
Killing in relapse of mortality .
Let me speak proudly : tell the constable ,
We are but warriors for the working-day ;
Our gayness and our gilt are all besmirch'd 
With rainy marching in the painful field ;
There's not a piece of feather in our host 
Good argument , I hope , we will not fly 
And time hath worn us into slovenry :
But , by the mass , our hearts are in the trim ;
And my poor soldiers tell me , yet ere night 
They'll be in fresher robes , or they will pluck 
The gay new coats o'er the French soldiers' heads ,
And turn them out of service . If they do this ,
As , if God please , they shall ,my ransom then 
Will soon be levied . Herald , save thou thy labour ;
Come thou no more for ransom , gentle herald :
They shall have none , I swear , but these my joints ;
Which if they have as I will leave 'em them ,
Shall yield them little , tell the constable .

I shall , King Harry . And so , fare thee well :
Thou never shalt hear herald any more .


I fear thou'lt once more come again for ransom .


My lord , most humbly on my knee I beg 
The leading of the vaward .

Take it , brave York . Now , soldiers , march away :
And how thou pleasest , God , dispose the day !


Yield , cur !

Je pense que vous estes le gentilhomme de bonne qualit .

Quality , Calen O custure me , Art thou a gentleman ?
What is thy name , discuss .

O Seigneur Dieu !

O Signieur Dew should be a gentleman :
Perpend my words , O Signieur Dew , and mark :
O Signieur Dew , thou diest on point of fox 
Except , O signieur , thou do give to me 
Egregious ransom .

O , prenez misericorde , ayez piti  de moy !

Moy shall not serve ; I will have forty moys ;
Or I will fetch thy rim out at thy throat 
In drops of crimson blood .

Est-il impossible d'eschapper la force de ton bras ?

Brass , cur !
Thou damned and luxurious mountain goat ,
Offer'st me brass ?

O pardonnez moy !

Sayst thou me so , is that a ton of moys ?
Come hither , boy : ask me this slave in French 
What is his name .

Escoutez : comment estes vous appell ?

Monsieur le Fer .

He says his name is Master Fer .

Master Fer , I'll fer him , and firk him , and ferret him . Discuss the same in French unto him .

I do not know the French for fer , and ferret , and firk .

Bid him prepare , for I will cut his throat .

Que dit-il , monsieur ?

Il me commande   vous dire que vous faites vous prest ; car ce soldat icy est dispos  tout   cette heure de couper vostre gorge .

Ouy , cuppele gorge , permafoy .
Peasant , unless thou give me crowns , brave crowns ;
Or mangled shalt thou be by this my sword .

O , je vous supplie pour l'amour de 
Dieu , me pardonner , Je suis le gentilhomme de bonne maison : gardez ma vie , et je vous donneray deux cents escus .

What are his words ?

He prays you to save his life : he is a gentleman of a good house ; and , for his ransom he will give you two hundred crowns .

Tell him , my fury shall abate , and I 
The crowns will take .

Petit monsieur , que dit-il ?

Encore qu'il est contre son jurement de pardonner aucan prisonnier ; neant-moins , pour les escus que vous l'avez promis , il est content de vous donner la liberte , le franchisement .

Sur mes genoux , je vous donne mille remerciemens ; et je m'estime heureux que je suis tomb  entre les mains d'un chevalier , je pense , le plus brave , valiant , et tr s distingu  seigneur d'Angleterre .

Expound unto me , boy .

He gives you , upon his knees , a thousand thanks ; and he esteems himself happy that he hath fallen into the hands of one as he thinks the most brave , valorous , and thrice-worthy signieur of England .

As I suck blood , I will some mercy show .
Follow me !


Suivez vous le grand capitaine . I did never know so full a voice issue from so empty a heart : but the saying is true , 'The empty vessel makes the greatest sound .' Bardolph and Nym had ten times more valour than this roaring devil i' the old play , that every one may pare his nails with a wooden dagger ; and they are both hanged ; and so would this be if he durst steal anything adventurously . I must stay with the lackeys , with the luggage of our camp : the French might have a good prey of us , if he knew of it ; for there is none to guard it but boys .


O seigneur , le jour est perdu , tout est perdu !

Mort de ma vie , all is confounded , all !
Reproach and everlasting shame 
Sit mocking in our plumes . O meschante fortune !
Do not run away .


Why , all our ranks are broke .

O perdurable shame , let's stab ourselves .
Be these the wretches that we play'd at dice for ?

Is this the king we sent to for his ransom ?

Shame , and eternal shame , nothing but shame !
Let's die in honour , once more back again ;
And he that will not follow Bourbon now ,
Let him go hence , and with his cap in hand ,
Like a base pander , hold the chamber-door 
Whilst by a slave , no gentler than my dog ,
His fairest daughter is contaminated .

Disorder , that hath spoil'd us , friend us now !
Let us on heaps go offer up our lives .

We are enough yet living in the field 
To smother up the English in our throngs ,
If any order might be thought upon .

The devil take order now , I'll to the throng :
Let life be short , else shame will be too long .


Well have we done , thrice-valiant countrymen :
But all's not done ; yet keep the French the field .

The Duke of York commends him to your majesty .

Lives he , good uncle , thrice within this hour 
I saw him down ; thrice up again , and fighting ;
From helmet to the spur all blood he was .

In which array , brave soldier , doth he lie ,
Larding the plain ; and by his bloody side ,
Yoke-fellow to his honour-owing wounds ,
The noble Earl of Suffolk also lies .
Suffolk first died : and York , all haggled over ,
Comes to him , where in gore he lay insteep'd ,
And takes him by the beard , kisses the gashes 
That bloodily did yawn upon his face ;
And cries aloud , 'Tarry , dear cousin Suffolk !
My soul shall thine keep company to heaven ;
Tarry , sweet soul , for mine , then fly abreast ,
As in this glorious and well-foughten field ,
We kept together in our chivalry !' 
Upon these words I came and cheer'd him up :
He smil'd me in the face , raught me his hand ,
And with a feeble gripe says , 'Dear my lord ,
Commend my service to my sovereign .' 
So did he turn , and over Suffolk's neck 
He threw his wounded arm , and kiss'd his lips ;
And so espous'd to death , with blood he seal'd 
A testament of noble-ending love .
The pretty and sweet manner of it forc'd 
Those waters from me which I would have stopp'd ;
But I had not so much of man in me ,
And all my mother came into mine eyes 
And gave me up to tears .

I blame you not ;
For , hearing this , I must perforce compound 
With mistful eyes , or they will issue too .

But hark , what new alarum is this same ?
The French have reinforc'd their scatter'd men :
Then every soldier kill his prisoners !
Give the word through .


Kill the poys and the luggage , 'tis expressly against the law of arms : 'tis as arrant a piece of knavery , mark you now , as can be offer't : in your conscience now , is it not ?

'Tis certain , there's not a boy left alive ; and the cowardly rascals that ran from the battle have done this slaughter : besides , they have burned and carried away all that was in the king's tent ; wherefore the king most worthily hath caused every soldier to cut his prisoner's throat . O , 'tis a gallant king .

Ay , he was porn at Monmouth , Captain Gower . What call you the town's name where Alexander the Pig was born ?

Alexander the Great .

Why , I pray you , is not pig great , The pig , or the great , or the mighty , or the huge , or the magnanimous , are all one reckonings , save the phrase is a little variations .

I think Alexander the Great was born in Macedon : his father was called Philip of Macedon , as I take it .

I think it is in Macedon where Alexander is porn . I tell you , captain , if you look in the maps of the 'orld , I warrant you sall find , in the comparisons between Macedon and Monmouth , that the situations , look you , is both alike . There is a river in Macedon , and there is also moreover a river at Monmouth : it is called Wye at Monmouth ; but it is out of my prains what is the name of the other river ; but 'tis all one , 'tis alike as my fingers is to my fingers , and there is salmons in both . If you mark Alexander's life well , Harry of Monmouth's life is come after it indifferent well ; for there is figures in all things . Alexander ,God knows , and you know ,in his rages , and his furies , and his wraths , and his cholers , and his moods , and his displeasures , and his indignations , and also being a little intoxicates in his prains , did , in his ales and his angers , look you , kill his pest friend , Cleitus .

Our king is not like him in that : he never killed any of his friends .

It is not well done , mark you now , to take the tales out of my mouth , ere it is made and finished . I speak but in the figures and comparisons of it : as Alexander killed his friend Cleitus , being in his ales and his cups , so also Harry Monmouth , being in his right wits and his good judgments , turned away the fat knight with the great belly-doublet : he was full of jests , and gipes , and knaveries , and mocks ; I have forgot his name .

Sir John Falstaff .

That is he . I'll tell you , there is goot men porn at Monmouth .

Here comes his majesty .

I was not angry since I came to France 
Until this instant . Take a trumpet , herald ;
Ride thou unto the horsemen on yon hill :
If they will fight with us , bid them come down ,
Or void the field ; they do offend our sight .
If they'll do neither , we will come to them ,
And make them skirr away , as swift as stones 
Enforced from the old Assyrian slings .
Besides , we'll cut the throats of those we have ,
And not a man of them that we shall take 
Shall taste our mercy . Go and tell them so .


Here comes the herald of the French , my liege .

His eyes are humbler than they us'd to be .

How now , what means this , herald , know'st thou not 
That I have fin'd these bones of mine for ransom ?
Com'st thou again for ransom ?

No , great king .
I come to thee for charitable licence ,
That we may wander o'er this bloody field 
To book our dead , and then to bury them ;
To sort our nobles from our common men ;
For many of our princes woe the while !
Lie drown'd and soak'd in mercenary blood ;
So do our vulgar drench their peasant limbs 
In blood of princes ; and their wounded steeds 
Fret fetlock-deep in gore , and with wild rage 
Yerk out their armed heels at their dead masters ,
Killing them twice . O , give us leave , great king ,
To view the field in safety and dispose 
Of their dead bodies .

I tell thee truly , herald ,
I know not if the day be ours or no ;
For yet a many of your horsemen peer 
And gallop o'er the field .

The day is yours .

Praised be God , and not our strength , for it !
What is this castle call'd that stands hard by ?

They call it Agincourt .

Then call we this the field of Agincourt ,
Fought on the day of Crispin Crispianus .

Your grandfather of famous memory , an't please your majesty , and your great-uncle Edward the Plack Prince of Wales , as I have read in the chronicles , fought a most prave pattle here in France .

They did , Fluellen .

Your majesty says very true . If your majesties is remembered of it , the Welshmen did good service in a garden where leeks did grow , wearing leeks in their Monmouth caps ; which , your majesty know , to this hour is an honourable badge of the service ; and I do believe , your majesty takes no scorn to wear the leek upon Saint Tavy's day .

I wear it for a memorable honour ; For I am Welsh , you know , good countryman .

All the water in Wye cannot wash your majesty's Welsh plood out of your pody , I can tell you that : Got pless it and preserve it , as long as it pleases his grace , and his majesty too !

Thanks , good my countryman .

By Jeshu , I am your majesty's countryman , I care not who know it ; I will confess it to all the 'orld : I need not be ashamed of your majesty , praised be God , so long as your majesty is an honest man .

God keep me so , Our heralds go with him :
Bring me just notice of the numbers dead 
On both our parts . Call yonder fellow hither .


Soldier , you must come to the king .

Soldier , why wear'st thou that glove in thy cap ?

An't please your majesty , 'tis the gage of one that I should fight withal , if he be alive .

An Englishman ?

An't please your majesty , a rascal that swaggered with me last night ; who , if a' live and ever dare to challenge this glove , I have sworn to take him a box o' the ear : or , if I can see my glove in his cap ,which he swore as he was a soldier he would wear if alive ,I will strike it out soundly .

What think you , Captain Fluellen , is it fit this soldier keep his oath ?

He is a craven and a villain else , an't please your majesty , in my conscience .

It may be his enemy is a gentleman of great sort , quite from the answer of his degree .

Though he be as good a gentleman as the devil is , as Lucifer and Belzebub himself , it is necessary , look your Grace , that he keep his vow and his oath . If he be perjured , see you now , his reputation is as arrant a villain and a Jack-sauce as ever his black shoe trod upon God's ground and his earth , in my conscience , la !

Then keep thy vow , sirrah , when thou meetest the fellow .

So I will , my liege , as I live .

Who servest thou under ?

Under Captain Gower , my liege .

Gower is a goot captain , and is good knowledge and literatured in the wars .

Call him hither to me , soldier .

I will , my liege .


Here , Fluellen ; wear thou this favour for me and stick it in thy cap . When Alen on and myself were down together I plucked this glove from his helm : if any man challenge this , he is a friend to Alen on , and an enemy to our person ; if thou encounter any such , apprehend him , an thou dost me love .

Your Grace does me as great honours as can be desired in the hearts of his subjects : I would fain see the man that has but two legs that shall find himself aggriefed at this glove , that is all ; but I would fain see it once , and please God of his grace that I might see .

Knowest thou Gower ?

He is my dear friend , an't please you .

Pray thee , go seek him , and bring him to my tent .

I will fetch him .


My Lord of Warwick , and my brother Gloucester ,
Follow Fluellen closely at the heels .
The glove which I have given him for a favour ,
May haply purchase him a box o' the ear ;
It is the soldier's ; I by bargain should 
Wear it myself . Follow , good cousin Warwick :
If that the soldier strike him ,as , I judge 
By his blunt bearing he will keep his word ,
Some sudden mischief may arise of it ;
For I do know Fluellen valiant ,
And touch'd with choler , hot as gunpowder ,
And quickly will return an injury :
Follow and see there be no harm between them .
Go you with me , uncle of Exeter .


I warrant it is to knight you , captain .


God's will and his pleasure , captain , I peseech you now come apace to the king : there is more good toward you peradventure than is in your knowledge to dream of .

Sir , know you this glove ?

Know the glove , I know the glove is a glove .

I know this ; and thus I challenge it .


'Sblood , an arrant traitor as any's in the universal 'orld , or in France , or in England 

How now , sir , you villain !

Do you think I'll be forsworn ?

Stand away , Captain Gower ; I will give treason his payment into plows , I warrant you .

I am no traitor .

That's a lie in thy throat . I charge you in his majesty's name , apprehend him : he is a friend of the Duke Alen on's .


How now , how now , what's the matter ?

My Lord of Warwick , here is ,praised be God for it !a most contagious treason come to light , look you , as you shall desire in a summer's day . Here is his majesty .


How now , what's the matter ?

My liege , here is a villain and a traitor , that , look your Grace , has struck the glove which your majesty is take out of the helmet of Alen on .

My liege , this was my glove ; here is the fellow of it ; and he that I gave it to in change promised to wear it in his cap : I promised to strike him , if he did : I met this man with my glove in his cap , and I have been as good as my word .

Your majesty hear now ,saving your majesty's manhood ,what an arrant , rascally , beggarly , lousy knave it is . I hope your majesty is pear me testimony and witness , and avouchments , that this is the glove of Alen on that your majesty is give me ; in your conscience now .

Give me thy glove , soldier : look , here is the fellow of it .
'Twas I , indeed , thou promisedst to strike ;
And thou hast given me most bitter terms .

An't please your majesty , let his neck answer for it , if there is any martial law in the 'orld .

How canst thou make me satisfaction ?

All offences , my lord , come from the heart : never came any from mine that might offend your majesty .

It was ourself thou didst abuse .

Your majesty came not like yourself : you appeared to me but as a common man ; witness the night , your garments , your lowliness ; and what your highness suffered under that shape , I beseech you , take it for your own fault and not mine : for had you been as I took you for I made no offence ; therefore , I beseech your highness , pardon me .

Here , uncle Exeter , fill this glove with crowns ,
And give it to this fellow . Keep it , fellow ;
And wear it for an honour in thy cap 
Till I do challenge it . Give him the crowns :
And , captain , you must needs be friends with him .

By this day and this light , the fellow has mettle enough in his belly . Hold , there is twelve pence for you , and I pray you to serve God , and keep you out of prawls , and prabbles , and quarrels , and dissensions , and , I warrant you , it is the better for you .

I will none of your money .

It is with a good will ; I can tell you it will serve you to mend your shoes : come , wherefore should you be so pashful , your shoes is not so good : 'tis a good shilling , I warrant you , or I will change it .


Now , herald , are the dead number'd ?

Here is the number of the slaughter'd French .


What prisoners of good sort are taken , uncle ?

Charles Duke of Orleans , nephew to the king ;
John Duke of Bourbon , and Lord Bouciqualt :
Of other lords and barons , knights and squires ,
Full fifteen hundred , besides common men .

This note doth tell me of ten thousand French 
That in the field lie slain : of princes , in this number ,
And nobles bearing banners , there lie dead 
One hundred twenty-six : added to these ,
Of knights , esquires , and gallant gentlemen ,
Eight thousand and four hundred ; of the which 
Five hundred were but yesterday dubb'd knights :
So that , in these ten thousand they have lost ,
There are but sixteen hundred mercenaries ;
The rest are princes , barons , lords , knights , squires ,
And gentlemen of blood and quality .
The names of those their nobles that lie dead :
Charles Delabreth , High Constable of France ;
Jaques of Chatillon , Admiral of France ;
The master of the cross-bows , Lord Rambures ;
Great-master of France , the brave Sir Guischard Dauphin ;
John Duke of Alen on ; Antony Duke of Brabant ,
The brother to the Duke of Burgundy ,
And Edward Duke of Bar : of lusty earls ,
Grandpr  and Roussi , Fauconberg and Foix ,
Beaumont and Marle , Vaudemont and Lestrale .
Here was a royal fellowship of death !
Where is the number of our English dead ?

Edward the Duke of York , the Earl of Suffolk ,
Sir Richard Ketly , Davy Gam , esquire :
None else of name : and of all other men 
But five and twenty . O God , thy arm was here ;
And not to us , but to thy arm alone ,
Ascribe we all . When , without stratagem ,
But in plain shock and even play of battle ,
Was ever known so great and little loss 
On one part and on the other , Take it , God ,
For it is none but thine !

'Tis wonderful !

Come , go we in procession to the village :
And be it death proclaimed through our host 
To boast of this or take the praise from God 
Which is his only .

Is it not lawful , an please your majesty , to tell how many is killed ?

Yes , captain ; but with this acknowledgment ,
That God fought for us .

Yes , my conscience , he did us great good .

Do we all holy rites :
Let there be sung Non nobis and Te Deum ;
The dead with charity enclos'd in clay .
We'll then to Calais ; and to England then ,
Where ne'er from France arriv'd more happy men .

Vouchsafe to those that have not read the story ,
That I may prompt them : and of such as have ,
I humbly pray them to admit the excuse 
Of time , of numbers , and due course of things ,
Which cannot in their huge and proper life 
Be here presented . Now we bear the king 
Toward Calais : grant him there ; there seen ,
Heave him away upon your winged thoughts 
Athwart the sea . Behold , the English beach 
Pales in the flood with men , with wives , and boys ,
Whose shouts and claps out-voice the deep-mouth'd sea ,
Which , like a mighty whiffler 'fore the king ,
Seems to prepare his way : so let him land 
And solemnly see him set on to London .
So swift a pace hath thought that even now 
You may imagine him upon Blackheath ;
Where that his lords desire him to have borne 
His bruised helmet and his bended sword 
Before him through the city : he forbids it ,
Being free from vainness and self-glorious pride ;
Giving full trophy , signal and ostent ,
Quite from himself , to God . But now behold ,
In the quick forge and working-house of thought ,
How London doth pour out her citizens .
The mayor and all his brethren in best sort ,
Like to the senators of the antique Rome ,
With the plebeians swarming at their heels ,
Go forth and fetch their conquering C sar in :
As , by a lower but loving likelihood ,
Were now the general of our gracious empress ,
As in good time he may ,from Ireland coming ,
Bringing rebellion broached on his sword ,
How many would the peaceful city quit 
To welcome him , much more , and much more cause ,
Did they this Harry . Now in London place him ;
As yet the lamentation of the French 
Invites the King of England's stay at home ,
The emperor's coming in behalf of France ,
To order peace between them ;and omit 
All the occurrences , whatever chanc'd ,
Till Harry's back-return again to France :
There must we bring him ; and myself have play'd 
The interim , by remembering you 'tis past .
Then brook abridgment , and your eyes advance ,
After your thoughts , straight back again to France .

Nay , that's right ; but why wear you your leek to-day , Saint Davy's day is past .

There is occasions and causes why and wherefore in all things : I will tell you , asse my friend , Captain Gower . The rascally , scald , beggarly , lousy , pragging knave , Pistol ,which you and yourself and all the 'orld know to be no petter than a fellow ,look you now , of no merits , he is come to me and prings me pread and salt yesterday , look you , and pid me eat my leek . It was in a place where I could not preed no contention with him ; but I will be so pold as to wear it in my cap till I see him once again , and then I will tell him a little piece of my desires .

Why , here he comes , swelling like a turkey-cock .


'Tis no matter for his swellings nor his turkey-cocks . God pless you , Aunchient Pistol , you scurvy , lousy knave , God pless you !

Ha , art thou bedlam , dost thou thirst , base Troyan ,
To have me fold up Parca's fatal web ?
Hence , I am qualmish at the smell of leek .

I peseech you heartily , scurvy lousy knave , at my desires and my requests and my petitions to eat , look you , this leek ; pecause , look you , you do not love it , nor your affections and your appetites and your digestions does not agree with it , I would desire you to eat it .

Not for Cadwallader and all his goats .

There is one goat for you .
Will you be so good , scald knave , as eat it ?

Base Troyan , thou shalt die .

You say very true , scald knave , when 
God's will is . I will desire you to live in the mean time and eat your victuals ; come , there is sauce for it .

You called me yesterday mountain-squire , but I will make you to-day a squire of low degree . I pray you , fall to : if you can mock a leek you can eat a leek .

Enough , captain : you have astonished him .

I say , I will make him eat some part of my leek , or I will peat his pate four days . Bite , I pray you ; it is good for your green wound and your ploody coxcomb .

Must I bite ?

Yes , certainly , and out of doubt and out of question too and ambiguities .

By this leek , I will most horribly revenge . I eat and eat , I swear 

Eat , I pray you : will you have some more sauce to your leek , there is not enough leek to swear by .

Quiet thy cudgel : thou dost see I eat .

Much good do you , scald knave , heartily . Nay , pray you , throw none away ; the skin is good for your broken coxcomb . When you take occasions to see leeks hereafter , I pray you , mock at 'em ; that is all .

Good .

Ay , leeks is good . Hold you , there is a groat to heal your pate .

Me a groat !

Yes , verily and in truth , you shall take it ; or I have another leek in my pocket , which you shall eat .

I take thy groat in earnest of revenge .

If I owe you anything I will pay you in cudgels : you shall be a woodmonger , and buy nothing of me but cudgels . God be wi' you , and keep you , and heal your pate .


All hell shall stir for this .

Go , go ; you are a counterfeit cowardly knave . Will you mock at an ancient tradition , begun upon an honourable respect , and worn as a memorable trophy of predeceased valour , and dare not a vouch in your deeds any of your words , I have seen you gleeking and galling at this gentleman twice or thrice . You thought , because he could not speak English in the native garb , he could not therefore handle an English cudgel : you find it otherwise ; and henceforth let a Welsh correction teach you a good English condition . Fare ye well .


Doth Fortune play the huswife with me now ?
News have I that my Nell is dead i' the spital 
Of malady of France :
And there my rendezvous is quite cut off .
Old I do wax , and from my weary limbs 
Honour is cudgelled . Well , bawd I'll turn ,
And something lean to cutpurse of quick hand .
To England will I steal , and there I'll steal :
And patches will I get unto these cudgell'd scars ,
And swear I got them in the Gallia wars .

Peace to this meeting , wherefore we are met !
Unto our brother France , and to our sister ,
Health and fair time of day ; joy and good wishes 
To our most fair and princely cousin Katharine ;
And , as a branch and member of this royalty ,
By whom this great assembly is contriv'd ,
We do salute you , Duke of Burgundy ;
And , princes French , and peers , health to you all !

Right joyous are we to behold your face ,
Most worthy brother England ; fairly met :
So are you , princes English , every one .

So happy be the issue , brother England ,
Of this good day and of this gracious meeting ,
As we are now glad to behold your eyes ;
Your eyes , which hitherto have borne in them 
Against the French , that met them in their bent ,
The fatal balls of murdering basilisks :
The venom of such looks , we fairly hope ,
Have lost their quality , and that this day 
Shall change all griefs and quarrels into love .

To cry amen to that , thus we appear .

You English princes all , I do salute you .

My duty to you both , on equal love ,
Great Kings of France and England , That I have labour'd 
With all my wits , my pains , and strong endeavours ,
To bring your most imperial majesties 
Unto this bar and royal interview ,
Your mightiness on both parts best can witness .
Since then my office hath so far prevail'd 
That face to face , and royal eye to eye ,
You have congreeted , let it not disgrace me 
If I demand before this royal view ,
What rub or what impediment there is ,
Why that the naked , poor , and mangled Peace ,
Dear nurse of arts , plenties , and joyful births ,
Should not in this best garden of the world ,
Our fertile France , put up her lovely visage ?
Alas , she hath from France too long been chas'd ,
And all her husbandry doth lie on heaps ,
Corrupting in its own fertility .
Her vine , the merry cheerer of the heart ,
Unpruned dies ; her hedges even-pleach'd ,
Like prisoners wildly overgrown with hair ,
Put forth disorder'd twigs ; her fallow leas 
The darnel , hemlock and rank fumitory 
Doth root upon , while that the coulter rusts 
That should deracinate such savagery ;
The even mead , that erst brought sweetly forth 
The freckled cowslip , burnet , and green clover ,
Wanting the scythe , all uncorrected , rank ,
Conceives by idleness , and nothing teems 
But hateful docks , rough thistles , kecksies , burs ,
Losing both beauty and utility ;
And as our vineyards , fallows , meads , and hedges ,
Defective in their natures , grow to wildness ,
Even so our houses and ourselves and children 
Have lost , or do not learn for want of time ,
The sciences that should become our country ,
But grow like savages ,as soldiers will ,
That nothing do but meditate on blood ,
To swearing and stern looks , diffus'd attire ,
And every thing that seems unnatural .
Which to reduce into our former favour 
You are assembled ; and my speech entreats 
That I may know the let why gentle Peace 
Should not expel these inconveniences ,
And bless us with her former qualities .

If , Duke of Burgundy , you would the peace ,
Whose want gives growth to the imperfections 
Which you have cited , you must buy that peace 
With full accord to all our just demands ;
Whose tenours and particular effects 
You have , enschedul'd briefly , in your hands .

The king hath heard them ; to the which as yet ,
There is no answer made .

Well then the peace ,
Which you before so urg'd , lies in his answer .

I have but with a cursorary eye 
O'erglanc'd the articles : pleaseth your Grace 
To appoint some of your council presently 
To sit with us once more , with better heed 
To re-survey them , we will suddenly 
Pass our accept and peremptory answer .

Brother , we shall . Go , uncle Exeter ,
And brother Clarence , and you , brother Gloucester ,
Warwick and Huntingdon , go with the king ;
And take with you free power to ratify ,
Augment , or alter , as your wisdoms best 
Shall see advantageable for our dignity ,
Anything in or out of our demands ,
And we'll consign thereto . Will you , fair sister ,
Go with the princes , or stay here with us ?

Our gracious brother , I will go with them .
Haply a woman's voice may do some good 
When articles too nicely urg'd be stood on .

Yet leave our cousin Katharine here with us :
She is our capital demand , compris'd 
Within the fore-rank of our articles .

She hath good leave .


Fair Katharine , and most fair !
Will you vouchsafe to teach a soldier terms ,
Such as will enter at a lady's ear ,
And plead his love-suit to her gentle heart ?

Your majesty sall mock at me ; I cannot speak your England .

O fair Katharine , if you will love me soundly with your French heart , I will be glad to hear you confess it brokenly with your English tongue . Do you like me , Kate ?

Pardonnez moy , I cannot tell vat is 'like me .' 

An angel is like you , Kate ; and you are like an angel .

Que dit-il , que je suis semblable   les anges ?

Ouy , vrayment , sauf vostre grace , ainsi dit-il .

I said so , dear Katharine ; and I must not blush to affirm it .

O bon Dieu , les langues des hommes sont pleines des tromperies .

What says she , fair one , that the tongues of men are full of deceits ?

Ouy , dat de tongues of de mans is be full of deceits : dat is de princess .

The princess is the better Englishwoman . I' faith , Kate , my wooing is fit for thy understanding : I am glad thou canst speak no better English ; for , if thou couldst , thou wouldst find me such a plain king that thou wouldst think I had sold my farm to buy my crown . I know no ways to mince it in love , but directly to say 'I love you :' then , if you urge me further than to say 'Do you in faith ?' I wear out my suit . Give me your answer ; i' faith do : and so clap hands and a bargain . How say you , lady ?

Sauf vostre honneur , me understand vell .

Marry , if you would put me to verses , or to dance for your sake , Kate , why you undid me : for the one , I have neither words nor measure , and for the other , I have no strength in measure , yet a reasonable measure in strength . If I could win a lady at leap-frog , or by vaulting into my saddle with my armour on my back , under the correction of bragging be it spoken , I should quickly leap into a wife . Or if I might buffet for my love , or bound my horse for her favours , I could lay on like a butcher and sit like a jack-an-apes , never off . But before God , Kate , I cannot look greenly nor gasp out my eloquence , nor I have no cunning in protestation ; only downright oaths , which I never use till urged , nor never break for urging . If thou caust love a fellow of this temper , Kate . whose face is not worth sun-burning , that never looks in his glass for love of anything he sees there , let thine eye be thy cook . I speak to thee plain soldier : if thou canst love me for this , take me ; if not , to say to thee that I shall die , is true ; but for thy love , by the Lord , no ; yet I love thee too . And while thou livest , dear Kate , take a fellow of plain and uncoined constancy , for he perforce must do thee right , because he hath not the gift to woo in other places ; for these fellows of infinite tongue , that can rime themselves into ladies' favours , they do always reason themselves out again . What , a speaker is but a prater ; a rime is but a ballad . A good leg will fall , a straight back will stoop , a black beard will turn white , a curled pate will grow bald , a fair face will wither , a full eye will wax hollow , but a good heart , Kate , is the sun and the moon ; or , rather , the sun , and not the moon ; for it shines bright and never changes , but keeps his course truly . If thou would have such a one , take me ; and take me , take a soldier ; take a soldier , take a king . And what sayest thou then to my love , speak , my fair , and fairly , I pray thee .

Is it possible dat I sould love de enemy of France ?

No ; it is not possible you should love the enemy of France , Kate ; but , in loving me , you should love the friend of France ; for I love France so well , that I will not part with a village of it ; I will have it all mine : and , Kate , when France is mine and I am yours , then yours is France and you are mine .

I cannot tell vat is dat .

No , Kate , I will tell thee in French , which I am sure will hang upon my tongue like a new-married wife about her husband's neck , hardly to be shook off . Je quand sur le possession de France , et quand vous avez le possession de moy ,let me see , what then , Saint Denis be my speed !donc vostre est France , et vous estes mienne . It is as easy for me , Kate , to conquer the kingdom , as to speak so much more French : I shall never move thee in French , unless it be to laugh at me .

Sauf vostre honneur , le Fran ois que vous parlez est meilleur que l'Anglois lequel je parle .

No , faith , is't not , Kate ; but thy speaking of my tongue , and I thine , most truly falsely , must needs be granted to be much at one . But , Kate , dost thou understand thus much English , Canst thou love me ?

I cannot tell .

Can any of your neighbours tell , Kate , I'll ask them . Come , I know thou lovest me ; and at night when you come into your closet you'll question this gentlewoman about me ; and I know , Kate , you will to her dispraise those parts in me that you love with your heart : but , good Kate , mock me mercifully ; the rather , gentle princess , because I love thee cruelly . If ever thou be'st mine , Kate ,as I have a saving faith within me tells me thou shalt ,I get thee with scambling , and thou must therefore needs prove a good soldier-breeder . Shall not thou and I , between Saint Denis and Saint George , compound a boy , half French , half English , that shall go to Constantinople and take the Turk by the beard , shall we not , what sayest thou , my fair flower-de-luce ?

I do not know dat .

No ; 'tis hereafter to know , but now to promise : do but now promise , Kate , you will endeavour for your French part of such a boy , and for my English moiety take the word of a king and a bachelor . How answer you , la plus belle Katharine du monde , mon tr s cher et divine d esse ?

Your majest  ave fausse French enough to deceive de most sage demoiselle dat is en France .

Now , fie upon my false French , By mine honour , in true English I love thee , Kate : by which honour I dare not swear thou lovest me ; yet my blood begins to flatter me that thou dost , notwithstanding the poor and untempering effect of my visage . Now beshrew my father's ambition , he was thinking of civil wars when he got me : therefore was I created with a stubborn outside , with an aspect of iron , that , when I come to woo ladies I fright them . But , in faith , Kate , the elder I wax the better I shall appear : my comfort is , that old age , that ill layer-up of beauty , can do no more spoil upon my face : thou hast me , if thou hast me , at the worst ; and thou shalt wear me , if thou wear me , better and better . And therefore tell me , most fair Katharine , will you have me , Put off your maiden blushes ; avouch the thoughts of your heart with the looks of an empress ; take me by the hand , and say 'Harry of England , I am thine :' which word thou shalt no sooner bless mine ear withal , but I will tell thee aloud 'England is thine , Ireland is thine , France is thine , and Henry Plantagenet is thine ;' who , though I speak it before his face , if he be not fellow with the best king , thou shalt find the best king of good fellows . Come , your answer in broken music ; for thy voice is music , and thy English broken ; therefore , queen of all , Katharine , break thy mind to me in broken English : wilt thou have me ?

Dat is as it sall please de roy mon p re .

Nay , it will please him well , Kate ; it shall please him , Kate .

Den it sall also content me .

Upon that I kiss your hand , and I call you my queen .

Laissez , mon seigneur , laissez , laissez , Ma foy , je ne veux point que vous abaissez vostre grandeur , en baisant la main d'une vostre indigne serviteure : excusez moy , je vous supplie , mon tr s puissant seigneur .

Then I will kiss your lips , Kate .

Les dames , et demoiselles , pour estre bais es devant leur noces , il n'est pas la coutume de France .

Madam my interpreter , what says she ?

Dat it is not be de fashion pour les ladies of France ,I cannot tell what is baiser in English .

To kiss .

Your majesty entendre bettre que moy .

It is not a fashion for the maids in France to kiss before they are married , would she say ?

Ouy , vrayment .

O Kate , nice customs curtsy to great kings . Dear Kate , you and I cannot be confined within the weak list of a country's fashion : we are the makers of manners , Kate ; and the liberty that follows our places stops the mouths of all find-faults , as I will do yours , for upholding the nice fashion of your country in denying me a kiss : therefore , patiently , and yielding 

. You have witchcraft in your lips , Kate : there is more eloquence in a sugar touch of them , than in the tongues of the French council ; and they should sooner persuade Harry of England than a general petition of monarchs . Here comes your father .

God save your majesty , My royal cousin , teach you our princess English ?

I would have her learn , my fair cousin , how perfectly I love her ; and that is good English .

Is she not apt ?

Our tongue is rough , coz , and my condition is not smooth ; so that , having neither the voice nor the heart of flattery about me , I cannot so conjure up the spirit of love in her , that he will appear in his true likeness .

Pardon the frankness of my mirth if I answer you for that . If you would conjure in her , you must make a circle ; if conjure up Love in her in his true likeness , he must appear naked and blind . Can you blame her then , being a maid yet rosed over with the virgin crimson of modesty , if she deny the appearance of a naked blind boy in her naked seeing self , It were , my lord , a hard condition for a maid to consign to .

Yet they do wink and yield , as love is blind and enforces .

They are then excused , my lord , when they see not what they do .

Then , good my lord , teach your cousin to consent winking .

I will wink on her to consent , my lord , if you will teach her to know my meaning : for maids , well summered and warm kept , are like flies at Bartholomew-tide , blind , though they have their eyes ; and then they will endure handling , which before would not abide looking on .

This moral ties me over to time and a hot summer ; and so I shall catch the fly , your cousin , in the latter end , and she must be blind too .

As love is , my lord , before it loves .

It is so : and you may , some of you , thank love for my blindness , who cannot see many a fair French city for one fair French maid that stands in my way .

Yes , my lord , you see them perspectively , the cities turned into a maid ; for they are all girdled with maiden walls that war hath never entered .

Shall Kate be my wife ?

So please you .

I am content ; so the maiden cities you talk of may wait on her : so the maid that stood in the way for my wish shall show me the way to my will .

We have consented to all terms of reason .

Is't so , my lords of England ?

The king hath granted every article :
His daughter first , and then in sequel all ,
According to their firm proposed natures .

Only he hath not yet subscribed this :
Where your majesty demands , that the King of France , having any occasion to write for matter of grant , shall name your highness in this form , and with this addition , in French , Notre tr s cher filz Henry roy d'Angleterre , H retier de France ; and thus in Latin , Pr clarissimus filius noster Henricus , Rex Angli , et H res Franci .

Nor this I have not , brother , so denied ,
But your request shall make me let it pass .

I pray you then , in love and dear alliance ,
Let that one article rank with the rest ;
And thereupon give me your daughter .

Take her , fair son ; and from her blood raise up 
Issue to me ; that the contending kingdoms 
Of France and England , whose very shores look pale 
With envy of each other's happiness ,
May cease their hatred , and this dear conjunction 
Plant neighbourhood and Christian-like accord 
In their sweet bosoms , that never war advance 
His bleeding sword 'twixt England and fair France .

Amen !

Now , welcome , Kate : and bear me witness all ,
That here I kiss her as my sovereign queen .


God , the best maker of all marriages ,
Combine your hearts in one , your realms in one !
As man and wife , being two , are one in love ,
So be there 'twixt your kingdoms such a spousal 
That never may ill office , or fell jealousy ,
Which troubles oft the bed of blessed marriage ,
Thrust in between the paction of these kingdoms ,
To make divorce of their incorporate league ;
That English may as French , French Englishmen ,
Receive each other , God speak this Amen !

Amen !

Prepare we for our marriage : on which day ,
My Lord of Burgundy , we'll take your oath ,
And all the peers' , for surety of our leagues .
Then shall I swear to Kate , and you to me ;
And may our oaths well kept and prosperous be !

Thus far , with rough and all-unable pen ,
Our bending author hath pursu'd the story ;
In little room confining mighty men ,
Mangling by starts the full course of their glory .
Small time , but in that small most greatly liv'd 
This star of England : Fortune made his sword ,
By which the world's best garden he achiev'd ,
And of it left his son imperial lord .
Henry the Sixth , in infant bands crown'd King 
Of France and England , did this king succeed ;
Whose state so many had the managing ,
That they lost France and made his England bleed :
Which oft our stage hath shown ; and , for their sake ,
In your fair minds let this acceptance take .

THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV

 
Open your ears ; for which of you will stop 
The vent of hearing when loud Rumour speaks ?
I , from the orient to the drooping west ,
Making the wind my post-horse , still unfold 
The acts commenced on this ball of earth :
Upon my tongues continual slanders ride ,
The which in every language I pronounce ,
Stuffing the ears of men with false reports .
I speak of peace , while covert enmity 
Under the smile of safety wounds the world :
And who but Rumour , who but only I ,
Make fearful musters and prepar'd defence ,
Whilst the big year , swoln with some other grief ,
Is thought with child by the stern tyrant war ,
And no such matter , Rumour is a pipe 
Blown by surmises , jealousies , conjectures ,
And of so easy and so plain a stop 
That the blunt monster with uncounted heads ,
The still-discordant wavering multitude ,
Can play upon it . But what need I thus 
My well-known body to anatomize 
Among my household , Why is Rumour here ?
I run before King Harry's victory ;
Who in a bloody field by Shrewsbury 
Hath beaten down young Hotspur and his troops ,
Quenching the flame of bold rebellion 
Even with the rebels' blood . But what mean I 
To speak so true at first , my office is 
To noise abroad that Harry Monmouth fell 
Under the wrath of noble Hotspur's sword ,
And that the king before the Douglas' rage 
Stoop'd his anointed head as low as death .
This have I rumour'd through the peasant towns 
Between the royal field of Shrewsbury 
And this worm-eaten hold of ragged stone ,
Where Hotspur's father , old Northumberland ,
Lies crafty-sick . The posts come tiring on ,
And not a man of them brings other news 
Than they have learn'd of me : from Rumour's tongues 
They bring smooth comforts false , worse than true wrongs .


Who keeps the gate here , ho !

Where is the earl ?

What shall I say you are ?

Tell thou the earl 
That the Lord Bardolph doth attend him here .

His Lordship is walk'd forth into the orchard :
Please it your honour knock but at the gate ,
And he himself will answer .


Here comes the earl .


What news , Lord Bardolph , every minute now 
Should be the father of some stratagem .
The times are wild ; contention , like a horse 
Full of high feeding , madly hath broke loose 
And bears down all before him .

Noble earl ,
I bring you certain news from Shrewsbury .

Good , an God will !

As good as heart can wish .
The king is almost wounded to the death ;
And , in the fortune of my lord your son ,
Prince Harry slain outright ; and both the Blunts 
Kill'd by the hand of Douglas ; young Prince John 
And Westmoreland and Stafford fled the field .
And Harry Monmouth's brawn , the hulk Sir John ,
Is prisoner to your son : O , such a day ,
So fought , so follow'd , and so fairly won ,
Came not till now to dignify the times 
Since C sar's fortunes .

How is this deriv'd ?
Saw you the field , came you from Shrewsbury ?

I spake with one , my lord , that came from thence ;
A gentleman well bred and of good name ,
That freely render'd me these news for true .

Here comes my servant Travers , whom I sent 
On Tuesday last to listen after news .

My lord , I over-rode him on the way ;
And he is furnish'd with no certainties 
More than he haply may retail from me .


Now , Travers , what good tidings come with you ?

My lord , Sir John Umfrevile turn'd me back 
With joyful tidings ; and , being better hors'd ,
Out-rode me . After him came spurring hard 
A gentleman , almost forspent with speed ,
That stopp'd by me to breathe his bloodied horse .
He ask'd the way to Chester ; and of him 
I did demand what news from Shrewsbury .
He told me that rebellion had bad luck ,
And that young Harry Percy's spur was cold .
With that he gave his able horse the head ,
And , bending forward struck his armed heels 
Against the panting sides of his poor jade 
Up to the rowel-head , and , starting so ,
He seem'd in running to devour the way ,
Staying no longer question .

Ha , Again :
Said he young Harry Percy's spur was cold ?
Of Hotspur , Coldspur , that rebellion 
Had met ill luck ?

My lord , I'll tell you what :
If my young lord your son have not the day ,
Upon mine honour , for a silken point 
I'll give my barony : never talk of it .

Why should the gentleman that rode by Travers 
Give then such instances of loss ?

Who , he ?
He was some hilding fellow that had stolen 
The horse he rode on , and , upon my life ,
Spoke at a venture . Look , here comes more news .


Yea , this man's brow , like to a title-leaf ,
Foretells the nature of a tragic volume :
So looks the strond , whereon the imperious flood 
Hath left a witness'd usurpation .
Say , Morton , didst thou come from Shrewsbury ?

I ran from Shrewsbury , my noble lord ;
Where hateful death put on his ugliest mask 
To fright our party .

How doth my son and brother ?
Thou tremblest , and the whiteness in thy cheek 
Is apter than thy tongue to tell thy errand .
Even such a man , so faint , so spiritless ,
So dull , so dead in look , so woe-begone ,
Drew Priam's curtain in the dead of night ,
And would have told him half his Troy was burn'd ;
But Priam found the fire ere he his tongue ,
And I my Percy's death ere thou report'st it .
This thou wouldst say , 'Your son did thus and thus ;
Your brother thus ; so fought the noble Douglas ;' 
Stopping my greedy ear with their bold deeds :
But in the end , to stop mine ear indeed ,
Thou hast a sigh to blow away this praise ,
Ending with 'Brother , son , and all are dead .' 

Douglas is living , and your brother , yet ;
But , for my lord your son ,

Why , he is dead .
See , what a ready tongue suspicion hath !
He that but fears the thing he would not know 
Hath by instinct knowledge from others' eyes 
That what he fear'd is chanced . Yet speak , Morton :
Tell thou thy earl his divination lies ,
And I will take it as a sweet disgrace 
And make thee rich for doing me such wrong .

You are too great to be by me gainsaid ;
Your spirit is too true , your fears too certain .

Yet , for all this , say not that Percy's dead .
I see a strange confession in thine eye :
Thou shak'st thy head , and hold'st it fear or sin 
To speak a truth . If he be slain , say so ;
The tongue offends not that reports his death :
And he doth sin that doth belie the dead ,
Not he which says the dead is not alive .
Yet the first bringer of unwelcome news 
Hath but a losing office , and his tongue 
Sounds ever after as a sullen bell ,
Remember'd knolling a departing friend .

I cannot think , my lord , your son is dead .

I am sorry I should force you to believe 
That which I would to God I had not seen ;
But these mine eyes saw him in bloody state ,
Rendering faint quittance , wearied and outbreath'd ,
To Harry Monmouth ; whose swift wrath beat down 
The never-daunted Percy to the earth ,
From whence with life he never more sprung up .
In few , his death ,whose spirit lent a fire 
Even to the dullest peasant in his camp ,
Being bruited once , took fire and heat away 
From the best-temper'd courage in his troops ;
For from his metal was his party steel'd ;
Which once in him abated , all the rest 
Turn'd on themselves , like dull and heavy lead :
And as the thing that's heavy in itself ,
Upon enforcement flies with greatest speed ,
So did our men , heavy in Hotspur's loss ,
Lend to this weight such lightness with their fear 
That arrows fled not swifter toward their aim 
Than did our soldiers , aiming at their safety ,
Fly from the field . Then was that noble Worcester 
Too soon ta'en prisoner ; and that furious Scot ,
The bloody Douglas , whose well-labouring sword 
Had three times slain the appearance of the king ,
'Gan vail his stomach , and did grace the shame 
Of those that turn'd their backs ; and in his flight ,
Stumbling in fear , was took . The sum of all 
Is , that the king hath won , and hath sent out 
A speedy power to encounter you , my lord ,
Under the conduct of young Lancaster 
And Westmoreland . This is the news at full .

For this I shall have time enough to mourn .
In poison there is physic ; and these news ,
Having been well , that would have made me sick ,
Being sick , have in some measure made me well :
And as the wretch , whose fever-weaken'd joints ,
Like strengthless hinges , buckle under life ,
Impatient of his fit , breaks like a fire 
Out of his keeper's arms , even so my limbs ,
Weaken'd with grief , being now enrag'd with grief ,
Are thrice themselves . Hence , therefore , thou nice crutch !
A scaly gauntlet now , with joints of steel 
Must glove this hand : and hence , thou sickly quoif !
Thou art a guard too wanton for the head 
Which princes , flesh'd with conquest , aim to hit .
Now bind my brows with iron ; and approach 
The ragged'st hour that time and spite dare bring 
To frown upon the enrag'd Northumberland !
Let heaven kiss earth , now let not nature's hand 
Keep the wild flood confin'd , let order die !
And let this world no longer be a stage 
To feed contention in a lingering act ;
But let one spirit of the first-born Cain 
Reign in all bosoms , that , each heart being set 
On bloody courses , the rude scene may end ,
And darkness be the burier of the dead !

This strained passion doth you wrong , my lord .

Sweet earl , divorce not wisdom from your honour .

The lives of all your loving complices 
Lean on your health ; the which , if you give o'er 
To stormy passion must perforce decay .
You cast the event of war , my noble lord ,
And summ'd the account of chance , before you said ,
'Let us make head .' It was your presurmise 
That in the dole of blows your son might drop :
You knew he walk'd o'er perils , on an edge ,
More likely to fall in than to get o'er ;
You were advis'd his flesh was capable 
Of wounds and scars , and that his forward spirit 
Would lift him where most trade of danger rang'd :
Yet did you say , 'Go forth ;' and none of this ,
Though strongly apprehended , could restrain 
The stiff-borne action : what hath then befallen ,
Or what hath this bold enterprise brought forth ,
More than that being which was like to be ?

We all that are engaged to this loss 
Knew that we ventur'd on such dangerous seas 
That if we wrought out life 'twas ten to one ;
And yet we ventur'd , for the gain propos'd 
Chok'd the respect of likely peril fear'd ;
And since we are o'erset , venture again .
Come , we will all put forth , body and goods .

'Tis more than time : and , my most noble lord ,
I hear for certain , and do speak the truth ,
The gentle Archbishop of York is up ,
With well-appointed powers : he is a man 
Who with a double surety binds his followers .
My lord your son had only but the corpse' ,
But shadows and the shows of men to fight ;
For that same word , rebellion , did divide 
The action of their bodies from their souls ;
And they did fight with queasiness , constrain'd ,
As men drink potions , that their weapons only 
Seem'd on our side : but , for their spirits and souls ,
This word , rebellion , it had froze them up ,
As fish are in a pond . But now the bishop 
Turns insurrection to religion :
Suppos'd sincere and holy in his thoughts ,
He's follow'd both with body and with mind ,
And doth enlarge his rising with the blood 
Of fair King Richard , scrap'd from Pomfret stones ;
Derives from heaven his quarrel and his cause ;
Tells them he doth bestride a bleeding land ,
Gasping for life under great Bolingbroke ;
And more and less do flock to follow him .

I knew of this before ; but , to speak truth ,
This present grief had wip'd it from my mind .
Go in with me ; and counsel every man 
The aptest way for safety and revenge :
Get posts and letters , and make friends with speed :
Never so few , and never yet more need .


Sirrah , you giant , what says the doctor to my water ?

He said , sir , the water itself was a good healthy water ; but , for the party that owed it , he might have more diseases than he knew for .

Men of all sorts take a pride to gird at me : the brain of this foolish-compounded clay , man , is not able to invent anything that tends to laughter , more than I invent or is invented on me : I am not only witty in myself , but the cause that wit is in other men . I do here walk before thee like a sow that hath overwhelmed all her litter but one . If the prince put thee into my service for any other reason than to set me off , why then I have no judgment . Thou whoreson mandrake , thou art fitter to be worn in my cap than to wait at my heels . I was never manned with an agate till now ; but I will set you neither in gold nor silver , but in vile apparel , and send you back again to your master , for a jewel ; the juvenal , the prince your master , whose chin is not yet fledged . I will sooner have a beard grow in the palm of my hand than he shall get one on his cheek ; and yet he will not stick to say , his face is a face-royal : God may finish it when he will , it is not a hair amiss yet : he may keep it still as a face-royal , for a barber shall never earn sixpence out of it ; and yet he will be crowing as if he had writ man ever since his father was a bachelor . He may keep his own grace , but he is almost out of mine , I can assure him . What said Master Dombledon about the satin for my short cloak and my slops ?

He said , sir , you should procure him better assurance than Bardolph ; he would not take his bond and yours : he liked not the security .

Let him be damned like the glutton , may his tongue be hotter , A whoreson Achitophel , a rascally yea-forsooth knave , to bear a gentleman in hand , and then stand upon security . The whoreson smooth-pates do now wear nothing but high shoes , and bunches of keys at their girdles ; and if a man is thorough with them in honest taking up , then they must stand upon security . I had as lief they would put ratsbane in my mouth as offer to stop it with security . I looked a' should have sent me two and twenty yards of satin , as I am a true knight , and he sends me security . Well , he may sleep in security ; for he hath the horn of abundance , and the lightness of his wife shines through it : and yet cannot he see , though he have his own lanthorn to light him . Where's Bardolph ?

He's gone into Smithfield to buy your worship a horse .

I bought him in Paul's , and he'll buy me a horse in Smithfield : an I could get me but a wife in the stews , I were manned , horsed , and wived .


Sir , here comes the nobleman that committed the prince for striking him about Bardolph .

Wait close ; I will not see him .

What's he that goes there ?

Falstaff , an't please your lordship .

He that was in question for the robbery ?

He , my lord ; but he hath since done good service at Shrewsbury , and , as I hear , is now going with some charge to the Lord John of Lancaster .

What , to York , Call him back again .

Sir John Falstaff !

Boy , tell him I am deaf .

You must speak louder , my master is deaf .

I am sure he is , to the hearing of anything good . Go , pluck him by the elbow ; I must speak with him .

Sir John !

What , a young knave , and beg , Is there not wars , is there not employment , doth not the king lack subjects , do not the rebels want soldiers , Though it be a shame to be on any side but one , it is worse shame to beg than to be on the worst side , were it worse than the name of rebellion can tell how to make it .

You mistake me , sir .

Why , sir , did I say you were an honest man , setting my knighthood and my soldiership aside , I had lied in my throat if I had said so .

I pray you , sir , then set your knighthood and your soldiership aside , and give me leave to tell you you lie in your throat if you say I am any other than an honest man .

I give thee leave to tell me so , I lay aside that which grows to me , If thou gett'st any leave of me , hang me : if thou takest leave , thou wert better be hanged . You hunt-counter : hence , avaunt !

Sir , my lord would speak with you .

Sir John Falstaff , a word with you .

My good lord , God give your lordship good time of day . I am glad to see your lordship abroad ; I heard say your lordship was sick : I hope your lordship goes abroad by advice . Your lordship , though not clean past your youth , hath yet some smack of age in you , some relish of the saltness of time ; and I most humbly beseech your lordship to have a reverend care of your health .

Sir John , I sent for you before your expedition to Shrewsbury .

An't please your lordship , I hear his majesty is returned with some discomfort from Wales .

I talk not of his majesty . You would not come when I sent for you .

And I hear , moreover , his highness is fallen into this same whoreson apoplexy .

Well , heaven mend him , I pray you , let me speak with you .

This apoplexy is , as I take it , a kind of lethargy , an't please your lordship ; a kind of sleeping in the blood , a whoreson tingling .

What tell you me of it , be it as it is .

It hath its original from much grief , from study and perturbation of the brain . I have read the cause of his effects in Galen : it is a kind of deafness .

I think you are fallen into the disease , for you hear not what I say to you .

Very well , my lord , very well : rather , an't please you , it is the disease of not listening , the malady of not marking , that I am troubled withal .

To punish you by the heels would amend the attention of your ears ; and I care not if I do become your physician .

I am as poor as Job , my lord , but not so patient : your lordship may minister the potion of imprisonment to me in respect of poverty ; but how I should be your patient to follow your prescriptions , the wise may make some dram of a scruple , or indeed a scruple itself .

I sent for you , when there were matters against you for your life , to come speak with me .

As I was then advised by my learned counsel in the laws of this land-service , I did not come .

Well , the truth is , Sir John , you live in great infamy .

He that buckles him in my belt cannot live in less .

Your means are very slender , and your waste is great .

I would it were otherwise : I would my means were greater and my waist slenderer .

You have misled the youthful prince .

The young prince hath misled me : I am the fellow with the great belly , and he my dog .

Well , I am loath to gall a new-healed wound : your day's service at Shrewsbury hath a little gilded over your night's exploit on Gadshill : you may thank the unquiet time for your quiet o'er-posting that action .

My lord !

But since all is well , keep it so : wake not a sleeping wolf .

To wake a wolf is as bad as to smell a fox .

What , you are as a candle , the better part burnt out .

A wassail candle , my lord ; all tallow : if I did say of wax , my growth would approve the truth .

There is not a white hair on your face but should have his effect of gravity .

His effect of gravy , gravy , gravy .

You follow the young prince up and down , like his ill angel .

Not so , my lord ; your ill angel is light , but I hope he that looks upon me will take me without weighing : and yet , in some respects , I grant , I cannot go , I cannot tell . Virtue is of so little regard in these costermonger times that true valour is turned bear-herd : pregnancy is made a tapster , and hath his quick wit wasted in giving reckonings : all the other gifts appertinent to man , as the malice of this age shapes them , are not worth a gooseberry . You that are old consider not the capacities of us that are young ; you measure the heat of our livers with the bitterness of your galls ; and we that are in the vaward of our youth , I must confess , are wags too .

Do you set down your name in the scroll of youth , that are written down old with all the characters of age , Have you not a moist eye , a dry hand , a yellow cheek , a white beard , a decreasing leg , an increasing belly , Is not your voice broken , your wind short , your chin double , your wit single , and every part about you blasted with antiquity , and will you yet call yourself young , Fie , fie , fie , Sir John !

My lord , I was born about three of the clock in the afternoon , with a white head , and something a round belly . For my voice , I have lost it with hollaing , and singing of anthems . To approve my youth further , I will not : the truth is , I am only old in judgment and understanding ; and he that will caper with me for a thousand marks , let him lend me the money , and have at him , For the box o' the ear that the prince gave you , he gave it like a rude prince , and you took it like a sensible lord . I have checked him for it , and the young lion repents ; marry , not in ashes and sackcloth , but in new silk and old sack .

Well , God send the prince a better companion !

God send the companion a better prince , I cannot rid my hands of him .

Well , the king hath severed you and Prince Harry . I hear you are going with Lord John of Lancaster against the archbishop and the Earl of Northumberland .

Yea ; I thank your pretty sweet wit for it . But look you pray , all you that kiss my lady Peace at home , that our armies join not in a hot day ; for , by the Lord , I take but two shirts out with me , and I mean not to sweat extraordinarily : if it be a hot day , and I brandish anything but my bottle , I would I might never spit white again . There is not a dangerous action can peep out his head but I am thrust upon it . Well , I cannot last ever . But it was always yet the trick of our English nation , if they have a good thing , to make it too common . If you will needs say I am an old man , you should give me rest . I would to God my name were not so terrible to the enemy as it is : I were better to be eaten to death with rust than to be scoured to nothing with perpetual motion .

Well , be honest , be honest ; and God bless your expedition .

Will your lordship lend me a thousand pound to furnish me forth ?

Not a penny ; not a penny ; you are too impatient to bear crosses . Fare you well : commend me to my cousin Westmoreland .


If I do , fillip me with a three-man beetle . A man can no more separate age and covetousness than he can part young limbs and lechery ; but the gout galls the one , and the pox pinches the other ; and so both the degrees prevent my curses . Boy !

Sir !

What money is in my purse ?

Seven groats and twopence .

I can get no remedy against this consumption of the purse : borrowing only lingers and lingers it out , but the disease is incurable . Go bear this letter to my Lord of Lancaster ; this to the prince ; this to the Earl of Westmoreland ; and this to old Mistress Ursula , whom I have weekly sworn to marry since I perceived the first white hair on my chin . About it : you know where to find me .

A pox of this gout , or , a gout of this pox , for the one or the other plays the rogue with my great toe . 'Tis no matter if I do halt ; I have the wars for my colour , and my pension shall seem the more reasonable . A good wit will make use of anything ; I will turn diseases to commodity .


Thus have you heard our cause and known our means ;
And , my most noble friends , I pray you all ,
Speak plainly your opinions of our hopes :
And first , Lord Marshal , what say you to it ?

I well allow the occasion of our arms ;
But gladly would be better satisfied 
How in our means we should advance ourselves 
To look with forehead bold and big enough 
Upon the power and puissance of the king .

Our present musters grow upon the file 
To five-and-twenty thousand men of choice ;
And our supplies live largely in the hope 
Of great Northumberland , whose bosom burns 
With an incensed fire of injuries .

The question , then , Lord Hastings , standeth thus :
Whether our present five-and-twenty thousand 
May hold up head without Northumberland .

With him , we may .

Ay , marry , there's the point :
But if without him we be thought too feeble ,
My judgment is , we should not step too far 
Till we had his assistance by the hand ;
For in a theme so bloody-fao'd as this ,
Conjecture , expectation , and surmise 
Of aids incertain should not be admitted .

'Tis very true , Lord Bardolph ; for , indeed 
It was young Hotspur's case at Shrewsbury .

It was , my lord ; who lin'd himself with hope ,
Eating the air on promise of supply ,
Flattering himself with project of a power 
Much smaller than the smallest of his thoughts ;
And so , with great imagination 
Proper to madmen , led his powers to death ,
And winking leap'd into destruction .

But , by your leave , it never yet did hurt 
To lay down likelihoods and forms of hope .

Yes , if this present quality of war ,
Indeed the instant action ,a cause on foot ,
Lives so in hope , as in an early spring 
We see the appearing buds ; which , to prove fruit ,
Hope gives not so much warrant as despair 
That frosts will bite them . When we mean to build ,
We first survey the plot , then draw the model ;
And when we see the figure of the house ,
Then must we rate the cost of the erection ;
Which if we find outweighs ability ,
What do we then but draw anew the model 
In fewer offices , or at last desist 
To build at all , Much more , in this great work ,
Which is almost to pluck a kingdom down 
And set another up ,should we survey 
The plot of situation and the model ,
Consent upon a sure foundation ,
Question surveyors , know our own estate ,
How able such a work to undergo ,
To weigh against his opposite ; or else ,
We fortify in paper , and in figures ,
Using the names of men instead of men :
Like one that draws the model of a house 
Beyond his power to build it ; who , half through ,
Gives o'er and leaves his part-created cost 
A naked-subject to the weeping clouds ,
And waste for churlish winter's tyranny .

Grant that our hopes , yet likely of fair birth ,
Should be still-born , and that we now possess'd 
The utmost man of expectation ;
I think we are a body strong enough ,
Even as we are , to equal with the king .

What , is the king but five-and-twenty thousand ?

To us no more ; nay , not so much , Lord Bardolph .
For his divisions , as the times do brawl ,
Are in three heads : one power against the French ,
And one against Glendower ; perforce , a third 
Must take up us : so is the unfirm king 
In three divided , and his coffers sound 
With hollow poverty and emptiness .

That he should draw his several strengths together 
And come against us in full puissance ,
Need not be dreaded .

If he should do so ,
He leaves his back unarm'd , the French and Welsh 
Baying him at the heels : never fear that .

Who is it like should lead his forces hither ?

The Duke of Lancaster and Westmoreland ;
Against the Welsh , himself and Harry Monmouth :
But who is substituted 'gainst the French 
I have no certain notice .

Let us on 
And publish the occasion of our arms .
The commonwealth is sick of their own choice ;
Their over-greedy love hath surfeited .
A habitation giddy and unsure 
Hath he that buildeth on the vulgar heart .
O thou fond many , with what loud applause 
Didst thou beat heaven with blessing Bolingbroke 
Before he was what thou wouldst have him be :
And being now trimm'd in thine own desires ,
Thou , beastly feeder , art so full of him 
That thou provok'st thyself to cast him up .
So , so , thou common dog , didst thou disgorge 
Thy glutton bosom of the royal Richard ,
And now thou wouldst eat thy dead vomit up ,
And howl'st to find it . What trust is in these times ?
They that , when Richard liv'd , would have him die ,
Are now become enamour'd on his grave :
Thou , that threw'st dust upon his goodly head ,
When through proud London he came sighing on 
After the admired heels of Bolingbroke ,
Cry'st now , 'O earth , yield us that king again ,
And take thou this !' O , thoughts of men accurst !
Past and to come seem best ; things present worst .

Shall we go draw our numbers and set on ?

We are time's subjects , and time bids be gone .

Master Fang , have you entered the exion ?

It is entered .

Where's your yeoman , Is it a lusty yeoman , will a' stand to't ?

Sirrah , where's Snare ?

O Lord , ay , good Master Snare .

Here , here .

Snare , we must arrest Sir John Falstaff .

Yea , good Master Snare ; I have entered him and all .

It may chance cost some of us our lives , for he will stab .

Alas the day , take heed of him : he stabbed me in mine own house , and that most beastly . In good faith , he cares not what mischief he doth if his weapon be out : he will foin like any devil , he will spare neither man , woman , nor child .

If I can close with him I care not for his thrust .

No , nor I neither : I'll be at your elbow .

An I but fist him once ; an a' come but within my vice ,

I am undone by his going ; I warrant you , he's an infinitive thing upon my score . Good Master Fang , hold him sure : good Master Snare , let him not 'scape . A' comes continuantly to Pie-corner saving your manhoods to buy a saddle , and he's indited to dinner to the Lubber's Head in Lumbert-Street , to Master Smooth's the silkman : I pray ye , since my exion is entered , and my case so openly known to the world , let him be brought in to his answer . A hundred mark is a long one for a poor lone woman to bear ; and I have borne , and borne , and borne ; and have been fubbed off , and fubbed off , and fubbed off , from this day to that day , that it is a shame to be thought on . There is no honesty in such dealing ; unless a woman should be made an ass , and a beast , to bear every knave's wrong . Yonder he comes ; and that arrant malmseynose knave , Bardolph , with him . Do your offices , do your offices , Master Fang and Master Snare ; do me , do me , do me your offices .


How now , whose mare's dead , what's the matter ?

Sir John , I arrest you at the suit of Mistress Quickly .

Away , varlets , Draw , Bardolph : cut me off the villain's head ; throw the quean in the channel .

Throw me in the channel , I'll throw thee in the channel . Wilt thou , wilt thou , thou bastardly rogue , Murder , murder , Ah , thou honey-suckle villain , wilt thou kill God's officers and the king's , Ah , thou honey-seed rogue , thou art a honey-seed , a man-queller , and a woman-queller .

Keep them off , Bardolph .

A rescue , a rescue !

Good people , bring a rescue or two , Thou wo't , wo't thou , thou wo't , wo't ta , do , do , thou rogue , do , thou hemp-seed !

Away , you scullion , you rampallian , you fustilarian , I'll tickle your catastrophe .


What is the matter , keep the peace here , ho !

Good my lord , be good to me , I beseech you , stand to me !

How now , Sir John , what , are you brawling here ?
Doth this become your place , your time and business ?
You should have been well on your way to York .
Stand from him , fellow : wherefore hang'st upon him ?

O , my most worshipful lord , an't please your grace , I am a poor widow of Eastcheap , and he is arrested at my suit .

For what sum ?

It is more than for some , my lord ; it is for all , all I have . He hath eaten me out of house and home ; he hath put all my substance into that fat belly of his : but I will have some of it out again , or I will ride thee o' nights like the mare .

I think I am as like to ride the mare if I have any vantage of ground to get up .

How comes this , Sir John , Fie , what man of good temper would endure this tempest of exclamation , Are you not ashamed to enforce a poor widow to so rough a course to come by her own ?

What is the gross sum that I owe thee ?

Marry , if thou wert an honest man , thyself and the money too . Thou didst swear to me upon a parcel-gilt goblet , sitting in my Dolphin-chamber , at the round table , by a seacoal fire , upon Wednesday in Wheeson week , when the prince broke thy head for liking his father to a singing-man of Windsor , thou didst swear to me then , as I was washing thy wound , to marry me and make me my lady thy wife . Canst thou deny it , Did not goodwife Keech , the butcher's wife , come in then and call me gossip Quickly , coming in to borrow a mess of vinegar ; telling us she had a good dish of prawns ; whereby thou didst desire to eat some , whereby I told thee they were ill for a green wound , And didst thou not , when she was gone down-stairs , desire me to be no more so familiarity with such poor people ; saying that ere long they should call me madam , And didst thou not kiss me and bid me fetch thee thirty shillings , I put thee now to thy book-oath : deny it if thou canst .

My lord , this is a poor mad soul ; and she says up and down the town that her eldest son is like you . She hath been in good case , and the truth is , poverty hath distracted her . But for these foolish officers , I beseech you I may have redress against them .

Sir John , Sir John , I am well acquainted with your manner of wrenching the true cause the false way . It is not a confident brow , nor the throng of words that come with such more than impudent sauciness from you , can thrust me from a level consideration ; you have , as it appears to me , practised upon the easy-yielding spirit of this woman , and made her serve your uses both in purse and in person .

Yea , in troth , my lord .

Prithee , peace . Pay her the debt you owe her , and unpay the villany you have done her : the one you may do with sterling money , and the other with current repentance .

My lord , I will not undergo this sneap without reply . You call honourable boldness impudent sauciness : if a man will make curtsy , and say nothing , he is virtuous . No , my lord , my humble duty remembered , I will not be your suitor : I say to you , I do desire deliverance from these officers , being upon hasty employment in the king's affairs .

You speak as having power to do wrong : but answer in the effect of your reputation , and satisfy the poor woman .

Come hither , hostess .

Now , Master Gower , what news ?

The king , my lord , and Harry Prince of Wales 
Are near at hand : the rest the paper tells .


As I am a gentleman .

Nay , you said so before .

As I am a gentleman . Come , no more words of it .

By this heavenly ground I tread on , I must be fain to pawn both my plate and the tapestry of my dining-chambers .

Glasses , glasses , is the only drinking : and for thy walls , a pretty slight drollery , or the story of the Prodigal , or the German hunting in water-work , is worth a thousand of these bed-hangings and these fly-bitten tapestries . Let it be ten pound if thou canst . Come , an it were not for thy humours , there is not a better wench in England . Go , wash thy face , and draw thy action . Come , thou must not be in this humour with me ; dost not know me , Come , come , I know thou wast set on to this .

Prithee , Sir John , let it be but twenty nobles : i' faith , I am loath to pawn my plate , so God save me , la !

Let it alone ; I'll make other shift : you'll be a fool still .

Well , you shall have it , though I pawn my gown . I hope you'll come to supper . You'll pay me all together ?

Will I live ?

Go , with her , with her ; hook on , hook on .

Will you have Doll Tearsheet meet you at supper ?

No more words ; let's have her .


I have heard better news .

What's the news , my good lord ?

Where lay the king last night ?

At Basingstoke , my lord .

I hope , my lord , all's well : what is the news , my lord ?

Come all his forces back ?

No ; fifteen hundred foot , five hundred horse ,
Are march'd up to my Lord of Lancaster ,
Against Northumberland and the archbishop .

Comes the king back from Wales , my noble lord ?

You shall have letters of me presently .
Come , go along with me , good Master Gower .

My lord !

What's the matter ?

Master Gower , shall I entreat you with me to dinner ?

I must wait upon my good lord here ;
I thank you , good Sir John .

Sir John , you loiter here too long , being you are to take soldiers up in counties as you go .

Will you sup with me , Master Gower ?

What foolish master taught you these manners , Sir John ?

Master Gower , if they become me not , he was a fool that taught them me . This is the right fencing grace , my lord ; tap for tap , and so part fair .

Now the Lord lighten thee , thou art a great fool .


Before God , I am exceeding weary .

Is it come to that , I had thought weariness durst not have attached one of so high blood .

Faith , it does me , though it discolours the complexion of my greatness to acknowledge it . Doth it not show vilely in me to desire small beer ?

Why , a prince should not be so loosely studied as to remember so weak a composition .

Belike then my appetite was not princely got ; for , by my troth , I do now remember the poor creature , small beer . But , indeed , these humble considerations make me out of love with my greatness . What a disgrace is it to me to remember thy name , or to know thy face to-morrow , or to take note how many pair of silk stockings thou hast ; viz . these , and those that were thy peach-coloured ones , or to bear the inventory of thy shirts ; as , one for superfluity , and one other for use , But that the tennis-court-keeper knows better than I , for it is a low ebb of linen with thee when thou keepest not racket there ; as thou hast not done a great while , because the rest of thy low-countries have made a shift to eat up thy holland : and God knows whether those that bawl out the ruins of thy linen shall inherit his kingdom ; but the midwives say the children are not in the fault ; whereupon the world increases , and kindreds are mightily strengthened .

How ill it follows , after you have laboured so hard , you should talk so idly , Tell me , how many good young princes would do so , their fathers being so sick as yours at this time is ?

Shall I tell thee one thing , Poins ?

Yes , faith , and let it be an excellent good thing .

It shall serve among wits of no higher breeding than thine .

Go to ; I stand the push of your one thing that you will tell .

Marry , I tell thee , it is not meet that I should be sad , now my father is sick : albeit I could tell to thee ,as to one it pleases me , for fault of a better , to call my friend ,I could be sad , and sad indeed too .

Very hardly upon such a subject .

By this hand , thou thinkest me as far in the devil's book as thou and Falstaff for obduracy and persistency : let the end try the man . But I tell thee my heart bleeds inwardly that my father is so sick ; and keeping such vile company as thou art hath in reason taken from me all ostentation of sorrow .

The reason ?

What wouldst thou think of me if I should weep ?

I would think thee a most princely hypocrite .

It would be every man's thought ; and thou art a blessed fellow to think as every man thinks : never a man's thought in the world keeps the road-way better than thine : every man would think me a hypocrite indeed . And what accites your most worshipful thought to think so ?

Why , because you have been so lewd and so much engraffed to Falstaff .

And to thee .

By this light , I am well spoke on ; I can hear it with mine own ears : the worst that they can say of me is that I am a second brother and that I am a proper fellow of my hands ; and these two things I confess I cannot help . By the mass , here comes Bardolph .


And the boy that I gave Falstaff : a' had him from me Christian ; and look , if the fat villain have not transformed him ape .

God save your Grace !

And yours , most noble Bardolph .

Come , you virtuous ass , you bashful fool , must you be blushing , wherefore blush you now , What a maidenly man-at-arms are you become , Is it such a matter to get a pottle-pot's maidenhead ?

A' calls me even now , my lord , through a red lattice , and I could discern no part of his face from the window : at last , I spied his eyes , and methought he had made two holes in the ale-wife's new petticoat , and peeped through .

Hath not the boy profited ?

Away , you whoreson upright rabbit , away !

Away , you rascally Althea's dream , away !

Instruct us , boy ; what dream , boy ?

Marry , my lord , Althea dreamed she was delivered of a firebrand ; and therefore I call him her dream .

A crown's worth of good interpretation . There it is , boy .


O , that this good blossom could be kept from cankers . Well , there is sixpence to preserve thee .

An you do not make him be hanged among you , the gallows shall have wrong .

And how doth thy master , Bardolph ?

Well , my lord . He heard of your Grace's coming to town : there's a letter for you .

Delivered with good respect . And how doth the martlemas , your master ?

In bodily health , sir .

Marry , the immortal part needs a physician ; but that moves not him : though that be sick , it dies not .

I do allow this wen to be as familiar with me as my dog ; and he holds his place , for look you how he writes .

'John Falstaff , knight ,' every man must know that , as oft as he has occasion to name himself : even like those that are akin to the king , for they never prick their finger but they say , 'There is some of the king's blood spilt .' 'How comes that ?' says he that takes upon him not to conceive . The answer is as ready as a borrower's cap , 'I am the king's poor cousin , sir .' 

Nay , they will be kin to us , or they will fetch it from Japhet . But to the letter :

Sir John Falstaff , knight , to the son of the king nearest his father , Harry Prince of Wales , greeting . Why , this is a certificate .

Peace !

I will imitate the honourable Romans in brevity : sure he means brevity in breath , short-winded .I commend me to thee , I commend thee , and I leave thee . Be not too familiar with Poins ; for he misuses thy favours so much that he swears thou art to marry his sister Nell . Repent at idle times as thou mayest , and so farewell .

My lord , I'll steep this letter in sack and make him eat it .

That's to make him eat twenty of his words . But do you use me thus , Ned , must I marry your sister ?

God send the wench no worse fortune , but I never said so .

Well , thus we play the fools with the time , and the spirits of the wise sit in the clouds and mock us . Is your master here in London ?

Yes , my lord .

Where sups he , doth the old boar feed in the old frank ?

At the old place , my lord , in Eastcheap .

What company ?

Ephesians , my lord , of the old church .

Sup any women with him ?

None , my lord , but old Mistress Quickly and Mistress Doll Tearsheet .

What pagan may that be ?

A proper gentlewoman , sir , and a kinswoman of my master's .

Even such kin as the parish heifers are to the town bull . Shall we steal upon them , Ned , at supper ?

I am your shadow , my lord ; I'll follow you .

Sirrah , you boy , and Bardolph ; no word to your master that I am yet come to town : there's for your silence .


I have no tongue , sir .

And for mine , sir , I will govern it .

Fare ye well ; go .

This Doll Tearsheet should be some road .

I warrant you , as common as the way between Saint Alban's and London .

How might we see Falstaff bestow himself to-night in his true colours , and not ourselves be seen ?

Put on two leathern jerkins and aprons , and wait upon him at his table as drawers .

From a god to a bull , a heavy descension , it was Jove's case . From a prince to a prentice , a low transformation , that shall be mine ; for in every thing the purpose must weigh with the folly . Follow me , Ned .


I pray thee , loving wife , and gentle daughter ,
Give even way unto my rough affairs :
Put not you on the visage of the times ,
And be like them to Percy troublesome .

I have given over , I will speak no more :
Do what you will ; your wisdom be your guide .

Alas , sweet wife , my honour is at pawn ;
And , but my going , nothing can redeem it .

O , yet for God's sake , go not to these wars .
The time was , father , that you broke your word 
When you were more endear'd to it than now ;
When your own Percy , when my heart's dear Harry ,
Threw many a northward look to see his father 
Bring up his powers ; but he did long in vain .
Who then persuaded you to stay at home ?
There were two honours lost , yours and your son's :
For yours , the God of heaven brighten it !
For his , it stuck upon him as the sun 
In the grey vault of heaven ; and by his light 
Did all the chivalry of England move 
To do brave acts : he was indeed the glass 
Wherein the noble youth did dress themselves :
He had no legs , that practis'd not his gait ;
And speaking thick , which nature made his blemish ,
Became the accents of the valiant ;
For those that could speak low and tardily ,
Would turn their own perfection to abuse ,
To seem like him : so that , in speech , in gait ,
In diet , in affections of delight ,
In military rules , humours of blood ,
He was the mark and glass , copy and book ,
That fashion'd others . And him , O wondrous him !
O miracle of men , him did you leave ,
Second to none , unseconded by you ,
To look upon the hideous god of war 
In disadvantage ; to abide a field 
Where nothing but the sound of Hotspur's name 
Did seem defensible : so you left him .
Never , O , never , do his ghost the wrong 
To hold your honour more precise and nice 
With others than with him : let them alone .
The marshal and the archbishop are strong :
Had my sweet Harry had but half their numbers ,
To-day might I , hanging on Hotspur's neck ,
Have talk'd of Monmouth's grave .

Beshrew your heart ,
Fair daughter , you do draw my spirits from me 
With new lamenting ancient oversights .
But I must go and meet with danger there ,
Or it will seek me in another place ,
And find me worse provided .

O , fly to Scotland ,
Till that the nobles and the armed commons 
Have of their puissance made a little taste .

If they get ground and vantage of the king ,
Then join you with them , like a rib of steel ,
To make strength stronger ; but , for all our loves ,
First let them try themselves . So did your son ;
He was so suffer'd : so came I a widow ;
And never shall have length of life enough 
To rain upon remembrance with mine eyes ,
That it may grow and sprout as high as heaven ,
For recordation to my noble husband .

Come , come , go in with me . 'Tis with my mind 
As with the tide swell'd up unto its height ,
That makes a still-stand , running neither way :
Fain would I go to meet the archbishop ,
But many thousand reasons hold me back .
I will resolve for Scotland : there am I ,
Till time and vantage crave my company .


What the devil hast thou brought there , apple-johns , thou knowest Sir John cannot endure an apple-john .

Mass , thou sayst true . The prince once set a dish of apple-johns before him , and told him there were five more Sir Johns ; and , putting off his hat , said , 'I will now take my leave of these six dry , round , old withered knights .' It angered him to the heart ; but he hath forgot that .

Why then , cover , and set them down : and see if thou canst find out Sneak's noise ; Mistress Tearsheet would fain hear some music . Dispatch : the room where they supped is too hot ; they'll come in straight .

Sirrah , here will be the prince and Master Poins anon ; and they will put on two of our jerkins and aprons ; and Sir John must not know of it : Bardolph hath brought word .

By the mass , here will be old utis : it will be an excellent stratagem .

I'll see if I can find out Sneak .

I'faith , sweetheart , methinks now you are in an excellent good temperality : your pulsidge beats as extraordinarily as heart would desire ; and your colour , I warrant you , is as red as any rose ; in good truth , la , But , i' faith , you have drunk too much canaries , and that's a marvellous searching wine , and it perfumes the blood ere one can say , What's this , How do you now ?

Better than I was : hem !

Why , that's well said ; a good heart's worth gold . Lo , here comes Sir John .


When Arthur first in court Empty the jordan .

And was a worthy king . How now , Mistress Doll !

Sick of a calm : yea , good sooth .

So is all her sect ; an they be once in a calm they are sick .

You muddy rascal , is that all the comfort you give me ?

You make fat rascals , Mistress Doll .

I make them , gluttony and diseases make them ; I make them not .

If the cook help to make the gluttony , you help to make the diseases , Doll : we catch of you , Doll , we catch of you ; grant that , my poor virtue , grant that .

Ay , marry ; our chains and our jewels .

'Your brooches , pearls , and owches :' for to serve bravely is to come halting off you know : to come off the breach with his pike bent bravely , and to surgery bravely ; to venture upon the charged chambers bravely ,

Hang yourself , you muddy conger , hang yourself !

By my troth , this is the old fashion ; you two never meet but you fall to some discord : you are both , in good troth , as rheumatic as two dry toasts ; you cannot one bear with another's confirmities . What the good-year , one must bear , and that must be you : you are the weaker vessel , as they say , the emptier vessel .

Can a weak empty vessel bear such a huge full hogshead , there's a whole merchant's venture of Bourdeaux stuff in him : you have not seen a hulk better stuffed in the hold . Come , I'll be friends with thee , Jack : thou art going to the wars ; and whether I shall ever see thee again or no , there is nobody cares .


Sir , Ancient Pistol's below , and would speak with you .

Hang him , swaggering rascal , let him not come hither : it is the foul-mouthedest rogue in England .

If he swagger , let him not come here : no , by my faith ; I must live amongst my neighbours ; I'll no swaggerers : I am in good name and fame with the very best . Shut the door ; there comes no swaggerers here : I have not lived all this while to have swaggering now : shut the door , I pray you .

Dost thou hear , hostess ?

Pray you , pacify yourself , Sir John : there comes no swaggerers here .

Dost thou hear , it is mine ancient .

Tilly-fally , Sir John , never tell me : your ancient swaggerer comes not in my doors . I was before Master Tisick , the deputy , t'other day ; and , as he said to me ,'twas no longer ago than Wednesday last ,'Neighbour Quickly ,' says he ;Master Dumbe , our minister , was by then ;'Neighbour Quickly ,' says he , 'receive those that are civil , for ,' said he , 'you are in an ill name ;' now , a' said so , I can tell whereupon ; 'for ,' says he , 'you are an honest woman , and well thought on ; therefore take heed what guests you receive : receive ,' says he , 'no swaggering companions .' There comes none here :you would bless you to hear what he said . No , I'll no swaggerers .

He's no swaggerer , hostess ; a tame cheater , i' faith ; you may stroke him as gently as a puppy greyhound : he will not swagger with a Barbary hen if her feathers turn back in any show of resistance . Call him up , drawer .


Cheater , call you him , I will bar no honest man my house , nor no cheater ; but I do not love swaggering , by my troth ; I am the worse , when one says swagger . Feel , masters , how I shake ; look you , I warrant you .

So you do , hostess .

Do I , yea , in very truth , do I , an 'twere an aspen leaf : I cannot abide swaggerers .


God save you , Sir John !

Welcome , Ancient Pistol . Here , Pistol , I charge you with a cup of sack : do you discharge upon mine hostess .

I will discharge upon her , Sir John , with two bullets .

She is pistol-proof , sir ; you shall hardly offend her .

Come , I'll drink no proofs nor no bullets : I'll drink no more than will do me good , for no man's pleasure , I .

Then to you , Mistress Dorothy ; I will charge you .

Charge me , I scorn you , scurvy companion . What , you poor , base , rascally , cheating , lack-linen mate , Away , you mouldy rogue , away , I am meat for your master .

I know you , Mistress Dorothy .

Away , you cut-purse rascal , you filthy bung , away , By this wine , I'll thrust my knife in your mouldy chaps an you play the saucy cuttle with me . Away , you bottle-ale rascal , you basket-hilt stale juggler , you , Since when , I pray you , sir , God's light , with two points on your shoulder , much !

God let me not live . I will murder your ruff for this !

No more , Pistol : I would not have you go off here . Discharge yourself of our company , Pistol .

No , good captain Pistol ; not here , sweet captain .

Captain , thou abominable damned cheater , art thou not ashamed to be called captain , An captains were of my mind , they would truncheon you out for taking their names upon you before you have earned them . You a captain , you slave , for what , for tearing a poor whore's ruff in a bawdy-house , He a captain , Hang him , rogue , He lives upon mouldy stewed prunes and dried cakes . A captain , God's light , these villains will make the word captain as odious as the word 'occupy ,' which was an excellent good word before it was ill sorted : therefore captains had need look to it .

Pray thee , go down , good ancient .

Hark thee hither , Mistress Doll .

Not I ; I tell thee what , Corporal Bardolph ; I could tear her . I'll be revenged of her .

Pray thee , go down .

I'll see her damned first ; to Pluto's damned lake , by this hand , to the infernal deep , with Erebus and tortures vile also . Hold hook and line , say I . Down , down , dogs , down fates , Have we not Hiren here ?

Good Captain Peesel , be quiet ; it is very late , i' faith . I beseek you now , aggravate your choler .

These be good humours , indeed , Shall pack-horses ,
And hollow pamper'd jades of Asia ,
Which cannot go but thirty miles a day ,
Compare with C sars , and with Cannibals ,
And Trojan Greeks , nay , rather damn them with 
King Cerberus ; and let the welkin roar .
Shall we fall foul for toys ?

By my troth , captain , these are very bitter words .

Be gone , good ancient : this will grow to a brawl anon .

Dio men like dogs , give crowns like pins , Have we not Hiren here ?

O' my word , captain , there's none such here . What the good-year , do you think I would deny her , for God's sake , be quiet .

Then feed , and be fat , my fair Calipolis .
Come , give's some sack .
Si fortuna me tormente , sperato me contento .
Fear we broadsides , no , let the fiend give fire :
Give me some sack ; and , sweetheart , lie thou there .

Come we to full points here , and are et ceteras nothing ?

Pistol , I would be quiet .

Sweet knight , I kiss thy neif . What , we have seen the seven stars .

For God's sake , thrust him down stairs , I cannot endure such a fustian rascal .

'Thrust him down stairs !' know we not Galloway nags ?

Quoit him down , Bardolph , like a shovegroat shilling : nay , an a' do nothing but speak nothing , a' shall be nothing here .

Come , get you down stairs .

What , shall we have incision , Shall we imbrue ?

Then death rock me asleep , abridge my doleful days !
Why then , let grievous , ghastly , gaping wounds 
Untwine the Sisters Three , Come , Atropos , I say !

Here's goodly stuff toward !

Give me my rapier , boy .

I pray thee , Jack , I pray thee , do not draw .

Get you down stairs .


Here's a goodly tumult , I'll forswear keeping house , afore I'll be in these tirrits and frights . So ; murder , I warrant now . Alas , alas , put up your naked weapons ; put up your naked weapons .


I pray thee , Jack , be quiet ; the rascal's gone . Ah , you whoreson little valiant villain , you !

Are you not hurt i' the groin , methought a' made a shrewd thrust at your belly .


Have you turned him out o' doors ?

Yes , sir : the rascal's drunk . You have hurt him , sir , i' the shoulder .

A rascal , to brave me !

Ah , you sweet little rogue , you , Alas , poor ape , how thou sweatest , Come , let me wipe thy face ; come on , you whoreson chops . Ah , rogue , i' faith , I love thee . Thou art as valorous as Hector of Troy , worth five of Agamemnon , and ten times better than the Nine Worthies . Ah , villain !

A rascally slave , I will toss the rogue in a blanket .

Do , an thou darest for thy heart : an thou dost , I'll canvass thee between a pair of sheets .


The music is come , sir .

Let them play . Play , sirs . Sit on my knee , Doll . A rascal bragging slave , the rogue fled from me like quicksilver .

I' faith , and thou followedst him like a church . Thou whoreson little tidy Bartholomew boar-pig , when wilt thou leave fighting o' days , and foining o' nights , and begin to patch up thine old body for heaven ?


Peace , good Doll , do not speak like a death's head : do not bid me remember mine end .

Sirrah , what humour is the prince of ?

A good shallow young fellow : a' would have made a good pantler , a' would have chipped bread well .

They say , Poins has a good wit .

He a good wit , hang him , baboon , his wit is as thick as Tewksbury mustard : there is no more conceit in him than is in a mallet .

Why does the prince love him so , then ?

Because their legs are both of a bigness , and he plays at quoits well , and eats conger and fennel , and drinks off candles' ends for flapdragons , and rides the wild mare with the boys , and jumps upon joint-stools , and swears with a good grace , and wears his boots very smooth , like unto the sign of the leg , and breeds no bate with telling of discreet stories ; and such other gambol faculties a' has , that show a weak mind and an able body , for the which the prince admits him : for the prince himself is such another ; the weight of a hair will turn the scales between their avoirdupois .

Would not this nave of a wheel have his ears cut off ?

Let's beat him before his whore .

Look , whether the withered elder hath not his poll clawed like a parrot .

Is it not strange that desire should so many years outlive performance ?

Kiss me , Doll .

Saturn and Venus this year in conjunction , what says the almanack to that ?

And , look , whether the fiery Trigon , his man , be not lisping to his master's old tables , his note-book , his counsel-keeper .

Thou dost give me flattering busses .

By my troth , I kiss thee with a most constant heart .

I am old , I am old .

I love thee better than I love e'er a scurvy young boy of them all .

What stuff wilt have a kirtle of , I shall receive money o' Thursday ; thou shalt have a cap to-morrow . A merry song , come : it grows late ; we'll to bed . Thou'lt forget me when I am gone .

By my troth , thou'lt set me a-weeping an thou sayst so : prove that ever I dress myself handsome till thy return . Well , hearken at the end .

Some sack , Francis !

Anon , anon , sir .

Anon , anon , sir .

Ha , a bastard son of the king's , And art not thou Poins his brother ?

Why , thou globe of sinful cntinents , what a life dost thou lead !

A better than thou : I am a gentleman ; thou art a drawer .

Very true , sir ; and I come to draw you out by the ears .

O , the Lord preserve thy good Grace ; by my troth , welcome to London . Now , the Lord bless that sweet face of thine , O Jesu , are you come from Wales ?

Thou whoreson mad compound of majesty , by this light flesh and corrupt blood 

thou art welcome .

How , you fat fool , I scorn you .

My lord , he will drive you out of your revenge and turn all to a merriment , if you take not the heat .

You whoreson candle-mine , you , how vilely did you speak of me even now before this honest , virtuous , civil gentlewoman !

Blessing on your good heart , and so she is , by my troth .

Didst thou hear me ?

Yea ; and you knew me , as you did when you ran away by Gadshill : you knew I was at your back , and spoke it on purpose to try my patience .

No , no , no ; not so ; I did not think thou wast within hearing .

I shall drive you then to confess the wilful abuse ; and then I know how to handle you .

No abuse , Hal , o' mine honour ; no abuse .

Not to dispraise me , and call me pantler and bread-chipper and I know not what ?

No abuse , Hal .

No abuse !

No abuse , Ned , in the world ; honest Ned , none . I dispraised him before the wicked , that the wicked might not fall in love with him ; in which doing I have done the part of a careful friend and a true subject , and thy father is to give me thanks for it . No abuse , Hal ; none , Ned , none : no , faith , boys , none .

See now , whether pure fear and entire cowardice doth not make thee wrong this virtuous gentlewoman to close with us , Is she of the wicked , Is thine hostess here of the wicked , Or is thy boy of the wicked , Or honest Bardolph , whose zeal burns in his nose , of the wicked ?

Answer , thou dead elm , answer .

The fiend hath pricked down Bardolph irrecoverable ; and his face is Lucifer's privykitchen , where he doth nothing but roast maltworms . For the boy , there is a good angel about him ; but the devil outbids him too .

For the women ?

For one of them , she is in hell already , and burns poor souls . For the other , I owe her money ; and whether she be damned for that , I know not .

No , I warrant you .

No , I think thou art not ; I think thou art quit for that . Marry , there is another indictment upon thee , for suffering flesh to be eaten in thy house , contrary to the law ; for the which I think thou wilt howl .

All victuallers do so : what's a joint of mutton or two in a whole Lent ?

You , gentlewoman ,

What says your Grace ?

His Grace says that which his flesh rebels against .


Who knocks so loud at door , Look to the door there , Francis .


Peto , how now , what news ?

The king your father is at Westminster ;
And there are twenty weak and wearied posts 
Come from the north : and as I came along ,
I met and overtook a dozen captains ,
Bare-headed , sweating , knocking at the taverns ,
And asking every one for Sir John Falstaff .

By heaven , Poins , I feel me much to blame ,
So idly to profane the precious time ,
When tempest of commotion , like the south ,
Borne with black vapour , doth begin to melt 
And drop upon our bare unarmed heads .
Give me my sword and cloak . Falstaff , good night .


Now comes in the sweetest morsel of the night , and we must hence and leave it unpicked .

More knocking at the door !

How now , what's the matter ?

You must away to court , sir , presently ;
A dozen captains stay at door for you .

Pay the musicians , sirrah . Farewell , hostess ; farewell , Doll . You see , my good wenches , how men of merit are sought after : the undeserver may sleep when the man of action is called on . Farewell , good wenches . If I be not sent away post , I will see you again ere I go .

I cannot speak ; if my heart be not ready to burst ,well , sweet Jack , have a care of thyself .

Farewell , farewell .


Well , fare thee well : I have known thee these twenty-nine years , come peascod-time ; but an honester , and truer-hearted man ,well , fare thee well .

Mistress Tearsheet !

What's the matter ?

Bid Mistress Tearsheet come to my master .

O , run , Doll , run ; run , good Doll .

Go , call the Earls of Surrey and of Warwick ;
But , ere they come , bid them o'er-read these letters ,
And well consider of them . Make good speed .

How many thousand of my poorest subjects 
Are at this hour asleep , O sleep , O gentle sleep !
Nature's soft nurse , how have I frighted thee ,
That thou no more wilt weigh my eyelids down 
And steep my senses in forgetfulness ?
Why rather , sleep , liest thou in smoky cribs ,
Upon uneasy pallets stretching thee ,
And hush'd with buzzing night-flies to thy slumber ,
Than in the perfum'd chambers of the great ,
Under the canopies of costly state ,
And lull'd with sound of sweetest melody ?
O thou dull god , why liest thou with the vile 
In loathsome beds , and leav'st the kingly couch 
A watch-case or a common 'larum bell ?
Wilt thou upon the high and giddy mast 
Seel up the ship-boy's eyes , and rock his brains 
In cradle of the rude imperious surge ,
And in the visitation of the winds ,
Who take the ruffian billows by the top ,
Curling their monstrous heads , and hanging them 
With deaf'ning clamour in the slippery clouds ,
That with the hurly death itself awakes ?
Canst thou , O partial sleep , give thy repose 
To the wet sea-boy in an hour so rude ,
And in the calmest and most stillest night ,
With all appliances and means to boot ,
Deny it to a king , Then , happy low , lie down !
Uneasy lies the head that wears a crown .


Many good morrows to your majesty !

Is it good morrow , lords ?

'Tis one o'clock , and past .

Why then , good morrow to you all , my lords .
Have you read o'er the letters that I sent you ?

We have , my liege .

Then you perceive the body of our kingdom ,
How foul it is ; what rank diseases grow ,
And with what danger , near the heart of it .

It is but as a body , yet , distemper'd ,
Which to his former strength may be restor'd 
With good advice and little medicine :
My Lord Northumberland will soon be cool'd .

O God , that one might read the book of fate ,
And see the revolution of the times 
Make mountains level , and the continent ,
Weary of solid firmness ,melt itself 
Into the sea , and , other times , to see 
The beachy girdle of the ocean 
Too wide for Neptune's hips ; how chances mock ,
And changes fill the cup of alteration 
With divers liquors , O , if this were seen ,
The happiest youth , viewing his progress through ,
What perils past , what crosses to ensue ,
Would shut the book , and sit him down and die .
'Tis not ten years gone 
Since Richard and Northumberland , great friends ,
Did feast together , and in two years after 
Were they at wars : it is but eight years since 
This Percy was the man nearest my soul ,
Who like a brother toil'd in my affairs 
And laid his love and life under my foot ;
Yea , for my sake , even to the eyes of Richard 
Gave him defiance . But which of you was by ,


You , cousin Nevil , as I may remember ,
When Richard , with his eye brimful of tears ,
Then check'd and rated by Northumberland ,
Did speak these words , now prov'd a prophecy ?
'Northumberland , thou ladder , by the which 
My cousin Bolingbroke ascends my throne ;' 
Though then , God knows , I had no such intent ,
But that necessity so bow'd the state 
That I and greatness were compelled to kiss :
'The time shall come ,' thus did he follow it ,
'The time will come , that foul sin , gathering head ,
Shall break into corruption :' so went on ,
Foretelling this same time's condition 
And the division of our amity .

There is a history in all men's lives ,
Figuring the nature of the times deceas'd ;
The which observ'd , a man may prophesy ,
With a near aim , of the main chance of things 
As yet not come to life , which in their seeds 
And weak leginnings lie intreasured .
Such things become the hatch and brood of time ;
And by the necessary form of this 
King Richard might create a perfect guess 
That great Northumberland , then false to him ,
Would of that seed grow to a greater falseness ,
Which should not find a ground to root upon ,
Unless on you .

Are these things then necessities ?
Then let us meet them like necessities ;
And that same word even now cries out on us .
They say the bishop and Northumberland 
Are fifty thousand strong .

It cannot be , my lord !
Rumour doth double , like the voice and echo ,
The numbers of the fear'd . Please it your Grace 
To go to bed : upon my soul , my lord ,
The powers that you already have sent forth 
Shall bring this prize in very easily .
To comfort you the more , I have receiv'd 
A certain instance that Glendower is dead .
Your majesty hath been this fortnight ill ,
And these unseason'd hours perforce must add 
Unto your sickness .

I will take your counsel :
And were these inward wars once out of hand ,
We would , dear lords , unto the Holy Land .


Come on , come on , come on , sir ; give me your hand , sir , give me your hand , sir : an early stirrer , by the rood , And how doth my good cousin Silence ?

Good morrow , good cousin Shallow .

And how doth my cousin , your bed-fellow , and your fairest daughter and mine , my god-daughter Ellen ?

Alas , a black ousel , cousin Shallow !

By yea and nay , sir , I dare say my cousin William is become a good scholar . He is at Oxford still , is he not ?

Indeed , sir , to my cost .

A' must , then , to the inns o' court shortly . I was once of Clement's Inn ; where I think they will talk of mad Shallow yet .

You were called 'lusty Shallow' then , cousin .

By the mass , I was called any thing ; and I would have done any thing indeed too , and roundly too . There was I , and Little John Doit of Staffordshire , and black George Barnes , and Francis Pickbone , and Will Squele a Cotswold man ; you had not four such swinge-bucklers in all the inns of court again : and , I may say to you , we knew where the bona-robas were , and had the best of them all at commandment . Then was Jack Falstaff , now Sir John , a boy , and page to Thomas Mowbray , Duke of Norfolk .

This Sir John , cousin , that comes hither anon about soldiers ?

The same Sir John , the very same . I saw him break Skogan's head at the court gate , when a' was a crack not thus high : and the very same day did I fight with one Sampson Stockfish , a fruiterer , behind Gray's Inn . Jesu , Jesu , the mad days that I have spent ; and to see how many of mine old acquaintance are dead !

We shall all follow , cousin .

Certain , 'tis certain ; very sure , very sure : death , as the Psalmist saith , is certain to all ; all shall die . How a good yoke of bullocks at Stamford fair ?

Truly , cousin , I was not there .

Death is certain . Is old Double of your town living yet ?

Dead , sir .

Jesu , Jesu , dead , a' drew a good bow ; and dead , a' shot a fine shoot : John a Gaunt loved him well , and betted much money on his head . Dead , a' would have clapped i' the clout at twelve score ; and carried you a forehand shaft a fourteen and fourteen and a half , that it would have done a man's heart good to see . How a score of ewes now ?

Thereafter as they be : a score of good ewes may be worth ten pounds .

And is old Double dead ?

Here come two of Sir John Falstaff's men , as I think .


Good morrow , honest gentlemen : I beseech you , which is Justice Shallow ?

I am Robert Shallow , sir ; a poor esquire of this county , and one of the king's justices of the peace : what is your good pleasure with me ?

My captain , sir , commends him to you ; my captain , Sir John Falstaff : a tall gentleman , by heaven , and a most gallant leader .

He greets me well , sir . I knew him a good backsword man . How doth the good knight , may I ask how my lady his wife doth ?

Sir , pardon ; a soldier is better accommodated than with a wife .

It is well said , in faith , sir ; and it is well said indeed too . 'Better accommodated !' it is good ; yea indeed , is it : good phrases are surely and ever were , very commendable . Accommodated , it comes of accommodo : very good ; a good phrase .

Pardon me , sir ; I have heard the word . 'Phrase ,' call you it , By this good day , I know not the phrase ; but I will maintain the word with my sword to be a soldier-like word , and a word of exceeding good command , by heaven . Accommodated ; that is , when a man is , as they say , accommodated ; or , when a man is , being , whereby , a' may be thought to be accommodated , which is an excellent thing .


It is very just . Look , here comes good Sir John . Give me your good hand , give me your worship's good hand . By my troth , you look well and bear your years very well : welcome , good Sir John .

I am glad to see you well , good Master Robert Shallow . Master Surecard , as I think .

No , Sir John ; it is my cousin , Silence , in commission with me .

Good Master Silence , it well befits you should be of the peace .

Your good worship is welcome .

Fie , this is hot weather , gentlemen .
Have you provided me here half a dozen sufficient men ?

Marry , have we , sir . Will you sit ?

Let me see them , I beseech you .

Where's the roll , where's the roll , where's the roll , Let me see , let me see , let me see . So , so , so , so , so , so , so : yea , marry , sir : Ralph Mouldy , let them appear as I call ; let them do so , let them do so . Let me see ; where is Mouldy ?

Here , an't please you .

What think you , Sir John , a goodlimbed fellow ; young , strong , and of good friends .

Is thy name Mouldy ?

Yea , an't please you .

'Tis the more time thou wert used .

Ha , ha , ha , most excellent , i' faith , things that are mouldy lack use : very singular good . In faith , well said , Sir John ; very well said .

Prick him .

I was pricked well enough before , an you could have let me alone : my old dame will be undone now for one to do her husbandry and her drudgery : you need not to have pricked me ; there are other men fitter to go out than I .

Go to : peace , Mouldy , you shall go . Mouldy , it is time you were spent .

Spent !

Peace , fellow , peace , stand aside : know you where you are , For the other , Sir John : let me see . Simon Shadow !

Yea , marry , let me have him to sit under : he's like to be a cold soldier .

Where's Shadow ?

Here , sir .

Shadow , whose son art thou ?

My mother's son , sir .

Thy mother's son , like enough , and thy father's shadow : so the son of the female is the shadow of the male : it is often so , indeed ; but not of the father's substance .

Do you like him , Sir John ?

Shadow will serve for summer ; prick him , for we have a number of shadows to fill up the muster-book .

Thomas Wart ?

Where's he ?

Here , sir .

Is thy name Wart ?

Yea , sir .

Thou art a very ragged wart .

Shall I prick him , Sir John ?

It were superfluous ; for his apparel is built upon his back , and the whole frame stands upon pins : prick him no more .

Ha , ha , ha , you can do it , sir ; you can do it : I commend you well . Francis Feeble !

Here , sir .

What trade art thou , Feeble ?

A woman's tailor , sir .

Shall I prick him , sir ?

You may ; but if he had been a man's tailor he'd have pricked you . Wilt thou make as many holes in an enemy's battle as thou hast done in a woman's petticoat ?

I will do my good will , sir : you can have no more .

Well said , good woman's tailor , well said , courageous Feeble , Thou wilt be as valiant as the wrathful dove or most magnanimous mouse . Prick the woman's tailor ; well , Master Shallow ; deep , Master Shallow .

I would Wart might have gone , sir .

I would thou wert a man's tailor , that thou mightst mend him , and make him fit to go . I cannot put him to a private soldier that is the leader of so many thousands : let that suffice , most forcible Feeble .

It shall suffice , sir .

I am bound to thee , reverend Feeble .
Who is next ?

Peter Bullcalf o' the green !

Yea , marry , let's see Bullcalf .

Here , sir .

'Fore God , a likely fellow , Come , prick me Bullcalf till he roar again .

O Lord , good my lord captain ,

What , dost thou roar before thou art pricked ?

O Lord , sir , I am a diseased man .

What disease hast thou ?

A whoreson cold , sir ; a cough , sir , which I caught with ringing in the king's affairs upon his coronation day , sir .

Come , thou shalt go to the wars in a gown ; we will have away thy cold ; and I will take such order that thy friends shall ring for thee . Is here all ?

Here is two more called than your number ; you must have but four here , sir : and so , I pray you , go in with me to dinner .

Come , I will go drink with you , but I cannot tarry dinner . I am glad to see you , by my troth , Master Shallow .

O , Sir John , do you remember since we lay all night in the windmill in Saint George's fields ?

No more of that , good Master Shallow , no more of that .

Ha , it was a merry night . And is Jane Nightwork alive ?

She lives , Master Shallow .

She never could away with me .

Never , never ; she would always say she could not abide Master Shallow .

By the mass , I could anger her to the heart . She was then a bona-roba . Doth she hold her own well ?

Old , old , Master Shallow .

Nay she must be old ; she cannot choose but be old ; certain she's old ; and had Robin Nightwork by old Nightwork before I came to Clement's Inn .

That's fifty-five year ago .

Ha , cousin Silence , that thou hadst seen that that this knight and I have seen . Ha , Sir John , said I well ?

We have heard the chimes at midnight , Master Shallow .

That we have , that we have , that we have ; in faith , Sir John , we have . Our watchword was , 'Hem , boys !' Come , let's to dinner ; come , let's to dinner . Jesus , the days that we have seen , Come , come .


Good Master Corporate Bardolph , stand my friend , and here's four Harry ten shillings in French crowns for you . In very truth , sir , I had as lief be hanged , sir , as go : and yet , for mine own part , sir , I do not care ; but rather , because I am unwilling , and , for mine own part , have a desire to stay with my friends : else , sir , I did not care , for mine own part , so much .

Go to ; stand aside .

And , good Master corporal captain , for my old dame's sake , stand my friend : she has nobody to do any thing about her , when I am gone ; and she is old , and cannot help herself . You shall have forty , sir .

Go to ; stand aside .

By my troth , I care not ; a man can die but once ; we owe God a death . I'll ne'er bear a base mind : an't be my destiny , so ; an't be not , so . No man's too good to serve's prince ; and let it go which way it will , he that dies this year is quit for the next .

Well said ; thou'rt a good fellow .

Faith , I'll bear no base mind .


Come , sir , which men shall I have ?

Four , of which you please .

Sir , a word with you . I have three pound to free Mouldy and Bullcalf .

Go to ; well .

Come , Sir John , which four will you have ?

Do you choose for me .

Marry , then , Mouldy , Bullcalf , Feeble , and Shadow .

Mouldy , and Bullcalf : for you , Mouldy , stay at home till you are past service : and for your part , Bullcalf , grow till you come unto it : I will none of you .

Sir John , Sir John , do not yourself wrong : they are your likeliest men , and I would have you served with the best .

Will you tell me , Master Shallow , how to choose a man , Care I for the limb , the thewes , the stature , bulk , and big assemblance of a man , Give me the spirit , Master Shallow . Here's Wart ; you see what a ragged appearance it is : a' shall charge you and discharge you with the motion of a pewterer's hammer , come off and on swifter than he that gibbets on the brewer's bucket . And this same half-faced fellow , Shadow , give me this man : he presents no mark to the enemy ; the foeman may with as great aim level at the edge of a penknife . And , for a retreat ; how swiftly will this Feeble the woman's tailor run off , O , give me the spare men , and spare me the great ones . Put me a caliver into Wart's hand , Bardolph .

Hold , Wart , traverse ; thus , thus , thus .

Come , manage me your caliver . So : very well : go to : very good : exceeding good . O , give me always a little , lean , old , chopp'd , bald shot . Well said , i' faith , Wart ; thou'rt a good scab : hold , there's a tester for thee .

He is not his craft's master , he doth not do it right . I remember at Mile-end Green , when I lay at Clement's Inn ,I was then Sir Dagonet in Arthur's show ,there was a little quiver fellow , and a' would manage you his piece thus : and a' would about and about , and come you in , and come you in ; 'rah , tah , tah ,' would a' say ; 'bounce ,' would a' say ; and away again would a' go , and again would a' come : I shall never see such a fellow .

These fellows will do well , Master Shallow . God keep you , Master Silence : I will not use many words with you . Fare you well , gentlemen both : I thank you : I must a dozen mile to-night . Bardolph , give the soldiers coats .

Sir John , the Lord bless you , and prosper your affairs , God send us peace , At your return visit our house ; let our old acquaintance be renewed : peradventure I will with ye to the court .

'Fore God I would you would , Master Shallow .

Go to ; I have spoke at a word . God keep you .

Fare you well , gentle gentlemen .

As I return , I will fetch off these justices : I do see the bottom of Justice Shallow . Lord , Lord , how subject we old men are to this vice of lying . This same starved justice hath done nothing but prate to me of the wildness of his youth and the feats he hath done about Turnbull Street ; and every third word a lie , duer paid to the hearer than the Turk's tribute . I do remember him at Clement's Inn like a man made after supper of a cheese-paring : when a' was naked he was for all the world like a forked radish , with a head fantastically carved upon it with a knife : a' was so forlorn that his dimensions to any thick sight were invincible : a' was the very genius of famine ; yet lecherous as a monkey , and the whores called him mandrake : a' came ever in the rearward of the fashion and sung those tunes to the over-scutched huswives that he heard the carmen whistle , and sware they were his fancies or his good-nights . And now is this Vice's dagger become a squire , and talks as familiarly of John a Gaunt as if he had been sworn brother to him ; and I'll be sworn a' never saw him but once in the Tilt-yard , and then he burst his head for crowding among the marshal's men . I saw it and told John a Gaunt he beat his own name ; for you might have thrust him and all his apparel into an eel-skin ; the case of a treble hautboy was a mansion for him , a court ; and now has he land and beefs . Well , I will be acquainted with him , if I return ; and it shall go hard but I will make him a philosopher's two stones to me . If the young dace be a bait for the old pike , I see no reason in the law of nature but I may snap at him . Let time shape , and there an end .

What is this forest call'd ?

'Tis Gaultree Forest , an't shall please your Grace .

Here stand , my lords , and send discovers forth ,
To know the numbers of our enemies .

We have sent forth already .

'Tis well done .
My friends and brethren in these great affairs ,
I must acquaint you that I have receiv'd 
New-dated letters from Northumberland ;
Their cold intent , tenour and substance , thus :
Here doth he wish his person , with such powers 
As might hold sortance with his quality ;
The which he could not levy ; whereupon 
He is retir'd , to ripe his growing fortunes ,
To Scotland ; and concludes in hearty prayers 
That your attempts may overlive the hazard 
And fearful meeting of their opposite .

Thus do the hopes we have in him touch ground 
And dash themselves to pieces .


Now , what news ?

West of this forest , scarcely off a mile ,
In goodly form comes on the enemy ;
And , by the ground they hide , I judge their number 
Upon or near the rate of thirty thousand .

The just proportion that we gave them out .
Let us sway on and face them in the field .


What well-appointed leader fronts us here ?

I think it is my Lord of Westmoreland .

Health and fair greeting from our general .
The Prince , Lord John and Duke of Lancaster .

Say on , my Lord of Westmoreland , in peace ,
What doth concern your coming .

Then , my lord ,
Unto your Grace do I in chief address 
The substance of my speech . If that rebellion 
Came like itself , in base and abject routs ,
Led on by bloody youth , guarded with rags ,
And countenanc'd by boys and beggary ;
I say , if damn'd commotion so appear'd ,
In his true , native , and most proper shape ,
You , reverend father , and these noble lords 
Had not been here , to dress the ugly form 
Of base and bloody insurrection 
With your fair honours . You , lord archbishop ,
Whose see is by a civil peace maintain'd ,
Whose beard the silver hand of peace hath touch'd ,
Whose learning and good letters peace hath tutor'd ,
Whose white investments figure innocence ,
The dove and very blessed spirit of peace ,
Wherefore do you so ill translate yourself 
Out of the speech of peace that bears such grace 
Into the harsh and boisterous tongue of war ;
Turning your books to greaves , your ink to blood ,
Your pens to lances , and your tongue divine 
To a loud trumpet and a point of war ?

Wherefore do I this , so the question stands .
Briefly to this end : we are all diseas'd ;
And , with our surfeiting and wanton hours 
Have brought ourselves into a burning fever ,
And we must bleed for it : of which disease 
Our late king , Richard , being infected , died .
But , my most noble Lord of Westmoreland ,
I take not on me here as a physician ,
Nor do I as an enemy to peace 
Troop in the throngs of military men ;
But rather show a while like fearful war ,
To diet rank minds sick of happiness 
And purge the obstructions which begin to stop 
Our very veins of life . Hear me more plainly :
I have in equal balance justly weigh'd 
What wrongs our arms may do , what wrongs we suffer ,
And find our griefs heavier than our offences .
We see which way the stream of time doth run 
And are enforc'd from our most quiet sphere 
By the rough torrent of occasion ;
And have the summary of all our griefs ,
When time shall serve , to show in articles ,
Which long ere this we offer'd to the king ,
And might by no suit gain our audience .
When we are wrong'd and would unfold our griefs ,
We are denied access unto his person 
Even by those men that most have done us wrong .
The dangers of the days but newly gone ,
Whose memory is written on the earth 
With yet appearing blood ,and the examples 
Of every minute's instance , present now ,
Have put us in these ill-beseeming arms ;
Not to break peace , or any branch of it ,
But to establish here a peace indeed ,
Concurring both in name and quality .

When ever yet was your appeal denied ?
Wherein have you been galled by the king ?
What peer hath been suborn'd to grate on you ,
That you should seal this lawless bloody book 
Of forg'd rebellion with a seal divine ,
And consecrate commotion's bitter edge ?

My brother general , the commonwealth ,
To brother born an household cruelty ,
I make my quarrel in particular .

There is no need of any such redress ;
Or if there were , it not belongs to you .

Why not to him in part , and to us all 
That feel the bruises of the days before ,
And suffer the condition of these times 
To lay a heavy and unequal hand 
Upon our honours ?

O , my good Lord Mowbray ,
Construe the times to their necessities ,
And you shall say indeed , it is the time ,
And not the king , that doth you injuries .
Yet , for your part , it not appears to me 
Either from the king or in the present time 
That you should have an inch of any ground 
To build a grief on : were you not restor'd 
To all the Duke of Norfolk's signories ,
Your noble and right well-remember'd father's ?

What thing , in honour , had my father lost ,
That need to be reviv'd and breath'd in me ?
The king that lov'd him as the state stood then ,
Was force perforce compell'd to banish him :
And then that Harry Bolingbroke and he ,
Being mounted and both roused in their seats ,
Their neighing coursers daring of the spur ,
Their armed staves in charge , their beavers down ,
Their eyes of fire sparkling through sights of steel ,
And the loud trumpet blowing them together ,
Then , then , when there was nothing could have stay'd 
My father from the breast of Bolingbroke ,
O , when the king did throw his warder down ,
His own life hung upon the staff he threw ;
Then threw he down himself and all their lives 
That by indictment and by dint of sword 
Have since miscarried under Bolingbroke .

You speak , Lord Mowbray , now you know not what .
The Earl of Hereford was reputed then 
In England the most valiant gentleman :
Who knows on whom Fortune would then have smil'd ?
But if your father had been victor there ,
He ne'er had borne it out of Coventry ;
For all the country in a general voice 
Cried hate upon him ; and all their prayers and love 
Were set on Hereford , whom they doted on 
And bless'd and grac'd indeed , more than the king .
But this is mere digression from my purpose .
Here come I from our princely general 
To know your griefs ; to tell you from his Grace 
That he will give you audience ; and wherein 
It shall appear that your demands are just ,
You shall enjoy them ; every thing set off 
That might so much as think you enemies .

But he hath forc'd us to compel this offer ,
And it proceeds from policy , not love .

Mowbray , you overween to take it so .
This offer comes from mercy , not from fear :
For , lo , within a ken our army lies 
Upon mine honour , all too confident 
To give admittance to a thought of fear .
Our battle is more full of names than yours ,
Our men more perfect in the use of arms ,
Our armour all as strong , our cause the best ;
Then reason will our hearts should be as good :
Say you not then our offer is compell'd .

Well , by my will we shall admit no parley .

That argues but the shame of your offence :
A rotten case abides no handling .

Hath the Prince John a full commission ,
In very ample virtue of his father ,
To hear and absolutely to determine 
Of what conditions we shall stand upon ?

That is intended in the general's name .
I muse you make so slight a question .

Then take , my Lord of Westmoreland , this schedule ,
For this contains our general grievances :
Each several article herein redress'd ;
All members of our cause , both here and hence ,
That are insinew'd to this action ,
Acquitted by a true substantial form 
And present execution of our wills 
To us and to our purposes consign'd ;
We come within our awful banks again 
And knit our powers to the arm of peace .

This will I show the general . Please you , lords ,
In sight of both our battles we may meet ;
And either end in peace , which God so frame !
Or to the place of difference call the swords 
Which must decide it .

My lord , we will do so .


There is a thing within my bosom tells me 
That no conditions of our peace can stand .

Fear you not that : if we can make our peace 
Upon such large terms , and so absolute 
As our condition shall consist upon ,
Our peace shall stand as firm as rocky mountains .

Yea , but our valuation shall be such 
That every slight and false-derived cause ,
Yea , every idle , nice , and wanton reason 
Shall to the king taste of this action ;
That , were our royal faiths martyrs in love ,
We shall be winnow'd with so rough a wind 
That even our corn shall seem as light as chaff 
And good from bad find no partition .

No , no , my lord . Note this ; the king is weary 
Of dainty and such picking grievances :
For he hath found to end one doubt by death 
Revives two greater in the heirs of life ;
And therefore will he wipe his tables clean ,
And keep no tell-tale to his memory 
That may repeat and history his loss 
To new remembrance ; for full well he knows 
He cannot so precisely weed this land 
As his misdoubts present occasion :
His foes are so enrooted with his friends 
That , plucking to unfix an enemy ,
He doth unfasten so and shake a friend .
So that this land , like an offensive wife ,
That hath enrag'd him on to offer strokes ,
As he is striking , holds his infant up 
And hangs resolv'd correction in the arm 
That was uprear'd to execution .

Besides , the king hath wasted all his rods 
On late offenders , that he now doth lack 
The very instruments of chastisement ;
So that his power , like to a fangless lion ,
May offer , but not hold .

'Tis very true :
And therefore be assur'd , my good lord marshal ,
If we do now make our atonement well ,
Our peace will , like a broken limb united ,
Grow stronger for the breaking .

Be it so .
Here is return'd my Lord of Westmoreland .


The prince is here at hand : pleaseth your lordship ,
To meet his Grace just distance 'tween our armies ?

Your Grace of York , in God's name then , set forward .

Before , and greet his Grace : my lord , we come .

You are well encounter'd here , my cousin Mowbray :
Good day to you , gentle lord archbishop ;
And so to you , Lord Hastings , and to all .
My Lord of York , it better show'd with you ,
When that your flock , assembled by the bell ,
Encircled you to hear with reverence 
Your exposition on the holy text 
Than now to see you here an iron man ,
Cheering a rout of rebels with your drum ,
Turning the word to sword and life to death .
That man that sits within a monarch's heart 
And ripens in the sunshine of his favour ,
Would he abuse the countenance of the king ,
Alack , what mischief might he set abroach 
In shadow of such greatness . With you , lord bishop ,
It is even so . Who hath not heard it spoken 
How deep you were within the books of God ?
To us , the speaker in his parliament ;
To us the imagin'd voice of God himself ;
The very opener and intelligencer 
Between the grace , the sanctities of heaven ,
And our dull workings . O , who shall believe 
But you misuse the reverence of your place ,
Employ the countenance and grace of heaven ,
As a false favourite doth his prince's name ,
In deeds dishonourable , You have taken up ,
Under the counterfeited zeal of God ,
The subjects of his substitute , my father ;
And both against the peace of heaven and him 
Have here upswarm'd them .

Good my Lord of Lancaster ,
I am not here against your father's peace ;
But , as I told my Lord of Westmoreland ,
The time misorder'd doth , in common sense ,
Crowd us and crush us to this monstrous form ,
To hold our safety up . I sent your Grace 
The parcels and particulars of our grief ,
The which hath been with scorn shov'd from the court ,
Whereon this Hydra son of war is born ;
Whose dangerous eyes may well be charm'd asleep 
With grant of our most just and right desires ,
And true obedience , of this madness cur'd ,
Stoop tamely to the foot of majesty .

If not , we ready are to try our fortunes 
To the last man .

And though we here fall down ,
We have supplies to second our attempt :
If they miscarry , theirs shall second them ;
And so success of mischief shall be born ,
And heir from heir shall hold this quarrel up 
Whiles England shall have generation .

You are too shallow , Hastings , much too shallow ,
To sound the bottom of the after-times .

Pleaseth your Grace , to answer them directly 
How far forth you do like their articles .

I like them all , and do allow them well ;
And swear here , by the honour of my blood ,
My father's purposes have been mistook ,
And some about him have too lavishly 
Wrested his meaning and authority .
My lord , these griefs shall be with speed redress'd ;
Upon my soul , they shall . If this may please you ,
Discharge your powers unto their several counties ,
As we will ours : and here between the armies 
Let's drink together friendly and embrace ,
That all their eyes may bear those tokens home 
Of our restored love and amity .

I take your princely word for these redresses .

I give it you , and will maintain my word :
And thereupon I drink unto your Grace .

Go , captain , and deliver to the army 
This news of peace : let them have pay , and part :
I know it will well please them : hie thee , captain .


To you , my noble Lord of Westmoreland .

I pledge your Grace : and , if you knew what pains 
I have bestow'd to breed this present peace ,
You would drink freely ; but my love to you 
Shall show itself more openly hereafter .

I do not doubt you .

I am glad of it .
Health to my lord and gentle cousin , Mowbray .

You wish me health in very happy season ;
For I am , on the sudden , something ill .

Against ill chances men are ever merry ,
But heaviness foreruns the good event .

Therefore be merry , coz ; since sudden sorrow 
Serves to say thus , Some good thing comes to morrow .

Believe me , I am passing light in spirit .

So much the worse if your own rule be true .


The word of peace is render'd : hark , how they shout !

This had been cheerful , after victory .

A peace is of the nature of a conquest ;
For then both parties nobly are subdu'd ,
And neither party loser .

Go , my lord ,
And let our army be discharged too .

And , good my lord , so please you , let our trains 
March by us , that we may peruse the men 
We should have cop'd withal .

Go , good Lord Hastings ,
And , ere they be dismiss'd , let them march by .


I trust , lords , we shall lie to-night together .

Now , cousin , wherefore stands our army still ?

The leaders , having charge from you to stand ,
Will not go off until they hear you speak .

They know their duties .


My lord , our army is dispers'd already :
Like youthful steers unyok'd , they take their courses 
East , west , north , south ; or , like a school broke up ,
Each hurries toward his home and sporting-place .

Good tidings , my Lord Hastings ; for the which 
I do arrest thee , traitor , of high treason :
And you , lord archbishop , and you , Lord Mowbray ,
Of capital treason I attach you both .

Is this proceeding just and honourable ?

Is your assembly so ?

Will you thus break your faith ?

I pawn'd thee none .
I promis'd you redress of these same grievances 
Whereof you did complain ; which , by mine honour ,
I will perform with a most Christian care .
But for you , rebels , look to taste the due 
Meet for rebellion and such acts as yours .
Most shallowly did you these arms commence ,
Fondly brought here and foolishly sent hence .
Strike up our drums , pursue the scatter'd stray :
God , and not we , hath safely fought to-day .
Some guard these traitors to the block of death ;
Treason's true bed , and yielder up of breath .


What's your name , sir , of what condition are you , and of what place , I pray ?

I am a knight , sir ; and my name is Colevile of the dale .

Well then , Colevile is your name , a knight is your degree , and your place the dale : Colevile shall still be your name , a traitor your degree , and the dungeon your place , a place deep enough ; so shall you be still Colevile of the dale .

Are not you Sir John Falstaff ?

As good a man as he , sir , whoe'er I am . Do ye yield , sir , or shall I sweat for you , If I do sweat , they are the drops of thy lovers , and they weep for thy death : therefore rouse up fear and trembling , and do observance to my mercy .

I think you are Sir John Falstaff , and in that thought yield me .

I have a whole school of tongues in this belly of mine , and not a tongue of them all speaks any other word but my name . An I had but a belly of any indifferency , I were simply the most active fellow in Europe : my womb , my womb , my womb undoes me . Here comes our general .


The heat is past , follow no further now .
Call in the powers , good cousin Westmoreland .

Now , Falstaff , where have you been all this while ?
When everything is ended , then you come :
These tardy tricks of yours will , on my life ,
One time or other break some gallows' back .

I would be sorry , my lord , but it should be thus : I never knew yet but rebuke and check was the reward of valour . Do you think me a swallow , an arrow , or a bullet , have I , in my poor and old motion , the expedition of thought , I have speeded hither with the very extremest inch of possibility ; I have foundered nine score and odd posts ; and here , travel-tainted as I am , have , in my pure and immaculate valour , taken Sir John Colevile of the dale , a most furious knight and valorous enemy . But what of that , he saw me , and yielded ; that I may justly say with the hook-nosed fellow of Rome , 'I came , saw , and overcame .' 

It was more of his courtesy than your deserving .

I know not : here he is , and here I yield him ; and I beseech your Grace , let it be booked with the rest of this day's deeds ; or , by the Lord , I will have it in a particular ballad else , with mine own picture on the top on't , Colevile kissing my foot . To the which course if I be enforced , if you do not all show like gilt two-pences to me , and I in the clear sky of fame o'ershine you as much as the full moon doth the cinders of the element , which show like pins' heads to her , believe not the word of the noble . Therefore let me have right , and let desert mount .

Thine's too heavy to mount .

Let it shine then .

Thine's too thick to shine .

Let it do something , my good lord , that may do me good , and call it what you will .

Is thy name Colevile ?

It is , my lord .

A famous rebel art thou , Colevile .

And a famous true subject took him .

I am , my lord , but as my betters are 
That led me hither : had they been rul'd by me 
You should have won them dearer than you have .

I know not how they sold themselves : but thou , like a kind fellow , gavest thyself away gratis , and I thank thee for thee .


Have you left pursuit ?

Retreat is made and execution stay'd .

Send Colevile with his confederates 
To York , to present execution .
Blunt , lead him hence , and see you guard him sure .

And now dispatch we toward the court , my lords :
I hear , the king my father is sore sick :
Our news shall go before us to his majesty ,
Which , cousin 

, you shall bear , to comfort him ;
And we with sober speed will follow you .

My lord , I beseech you , give me leave to go ,
Through Gloucestershire , and when you come to court 
Stand my good lord , pray , in your good report .

Fare you well , Falstaff : I , in my condition ,
Shall better speak of you than you deserve .


I would you had but the wit : 'twere better than your dukedom . Good faith , this same young sober-blooded boy doth not love me ; nor a man cannot make him laugh ; but that's no marvel , he drinks no wine . There's never none of these demure boys come to any proof ; for thin drink doth so over-cool their blood , and making many fish-meals , that they fall into a kind of male green-sickness ; and then , when they marry , they get wenches . They are generally fools and cowards , which some of us should be too but for inflammation . A good sherris-sack hath a two-fold operation in it . It ascends me into the brain ; dries me there all the foolish and dull and crudy vapours which environ it ; makes it apprehensive , quick , forgetive , full of nimble fiery and delectable shapes ; which , deliver'd o'er to the voice , the tongue , which is the birth , becomes excellent wit . The second property of your excellent sherris is , the warming of the blood ; which , before cold and settled , left the liver white and pale , which is the badge of pusillanimity and cowardice : but the sherris warms it and makes it course from the inwards to the parts extreme . It illumineth the face , which , as a beacon , gives warning to all the rest of this little kingdom , man , to arm ; and then the vital commoners and inland petty spirits muster me all to their captain , the heart , who , great and puffed up with this retinue , doth any deed of courage ; and this valour comes of sherris . So that skill in the weapon is nothing without sack , for that sets it a-work ; and leaining , a mere hoard of gold kept by a devil till sack commences it and sets it in act and use . Hereof comes it that Prince Harry is valiant ; for the cold blood he did naturally inherit of his father , he hath , like lean , sterile , and bare land , manured , husbanded , and tilled , with excellent endeavour of drinking good and good store of fertile sherris , that he is become very hot and valiant . If I had a thousand sons , the first human principle I would teach them should be , to forswear thin potations and to addict themselves to sack .

How now , Bardolph ?

The army is discharged all and gone .

Let them go . I'll through Gloucestershire ; and there will I visit Master Robert Shallow , esquire : I have him already tempering between my finger and my thumb , and shortly will I seal with him . Come away .


Now , lords , if God doth give successful end 
To this debate that bleedeth at our doors ,
We will our youth lead on to higher fields 
And draw no swords but what are sanctified .
Our navy is address'd , our power collected ,
Our substitutes in absence well invested ,
And everything lies level to our wish :
Only , we want a little personal strength ;
And pause us , till these rebels , now afoot ,
Come underneath the yoke of government .

Both which we doubt not but your majesty 
Shall soon enjoy .

Humphrey , my son of Gloucester ,
Where is the prince your brother ?

I think he's gone to hunt , my lord , at Windsor .

And how accompanied ?

I do not know , my lord .

Is not his brother Thomas of Clarence with him ?

No , my good lord ; he is in presence here .

What would my lord and father ?

Nothing but well to thee , Thomas of Clarence .
How chance thou art not with the prince thy brother ?
He loves thee , and thou dost neglect him , Thomas ;
Thou hast a better place in his affection 
Than all thy brothers : cherish it , my boy ,
And noble offices thou mayst effect 
Of mediation , after I am dead ,
Between his greatness and thy other brethren :
Therefore omit him not ; blunt not his love ,
Nor lose the good advantage of his grace 
By seeming cold or careless of his will ;
For he is gracious , if he be observ'd :
He hath a tear for pity and a hand 
Open as day for melting charity ;
Yet , notwithstanding , being incens'd , he's flint ;
As humorous as winter , and as sudden 
As flaws congealed in the spring of day .
His temper therefore must be well observ'd :
Chide him for faults , and do it reverently ,
When you perceive his blood inclin'd to mirth ;
But , being moody , give him line and scope ,
Till that his passions , like a whale on ground ,
Confound themselves with working . Learn this , Thomas ,
And thou shalt prove a shelter to thy friends ,
A hoop of gold to bind thy brothers in ,
That the united vessel of their blood ,
Mingled with venom of suggestion 
As , force perforce , the age will pour it in 
Shall never leak , though it do work as strong 
As aconitum or rash gunpowder .

I shall observe him with all care and love .

Why art thou not at Windsor with him , Thomas ?

He is not there to-day ; he dines in London .

And how accompanied , canst thou tell that ?

With Poins and other his continual followers .

Most subject is the fattest soil to weeds ;
And he , the noble image of my youth ,
Is overspread with them : therefore my grief 
Stretches itself beyond the hour of death :
The blood weeps from my heart when I do shape 
In forms imaginary the unguided days 
And rotten times that you shall look upon 
When I am sleeping with my ancestors .
For when his headstrong riot hath no curb ,
When rage and hot blood are his counsellors ,
When means and lavish manners meet together ,
O , with what wings shall his affections fly 
Towards fronting peril and oppos'd decay .

My gracious lord , you look beyond him quite :
The prince but studies his companions 
Like a strange tongue , wherein , to gain the language ,
'Tis needful that the most immodest word 
Be look'd upon , and learn'd ; which once attain'd ,
Your highness knows , comes to no further use 
But to be known and hated . So , like gross terms ,
The prince will in the perfectness of time 
Cast off his followers ; and their memory 
Shall as a pattern or a measure live ,
By which his Grace must mete the lives of others ,
Turning past evils to advantages .

'Tis seldom when the bee doth leave her comb 
In the dead carrion .

Who's here , Westmoreland !

Health to my sovereign , and new happiness 
Added to that that I am to deliver !
Prince John your son doth kiss your Grace's hand :
Mowbray , the Bishop Scroop , Hastings and all 
Are brought to the correction of your law .
There is not now a rebel's sword unsheath'd ,
But Peace puts forth her olive everywhere .
The manner how this action hath been borne 
Here at more leisure may your highness read ,
With every course in his particular .

O Westmoreland , thou art a summer bird ,
Which ever in the haunch of winter sings 
The lifting up of day .

Look , here's more news .

From enemies heaven keep your majesty ;
And , when they stand against you , may they fall 
As those that I am come to tell you of !
The Earl Northumberland , and the Lord Bardolph ,
With a great power of English and of Scots ,
Are by the sheriff of Yorkshire overthrown .
The manner and true order of the fight 
This packet , please it you , contains at large .

And wherefore should these good news make me sick ?
Will Fortune never come with both hands full 
But write her fair words still in foulest letters ?
She either gives a stomach and no food ;
Such are the poor , in health ; or else a feast 
And takes away the stomach ; such are the rich ,
That have abundance and enjoy it not .
I should rejoice now at this happy news ,
And now my sight fails , and my brain is giddy .
O me , come near me , now I am much ill .

Comfort , your majesty !

O my royal father !

My sovereign lord , cheer up yourself : look up !

Be patient , princes : you do know these fits 
Are with his highness very ordinary :
Stand from him , give him air ; he'll straight be well .

No , no ; he cannot long hold out these pangs :
The incessant care and labour of his mind 
Hath wrought the mure that should confine it in 
So thin , that life looks through and will break out .

The people fear me ; for they do observe 
Unfather'd heirs and loathly births of nature :
The seasons change their manners , as the year 
Had found some months asleep and leap'd them over .

The river hath thrice flow'd , no ebb between ;
And the old folk , time's doting chronicles ,
Say it did so a little time before 
That our great-grandsire , Edward , sick'd and died .

Speak lower , princes , for the king recovers .

This apoplexy will certain be his end .

I pray you take me up , and bear me hence 
Into some other chamber : softly , pray .

Let there be no noise made , my gentle friends ;
Unless some dull and favourable hand 
Will whisper music to my weary spirit .

Call for the music in the other room .

Set me the crown upon my pillow here .

His eye is hollow , and he changes much .

Less noise , less noise !


Who saw the Duke of Clarence ?

I am here , brother , full of heaviness .

How now , rain within doors , and none abroad !
How doth the king ?

Exceeding ill .

Heard he the good news yet ?
Tell it him .

He alter'd much upon the hearing it .

If he be sick with joy , he will recover without physic .

Not so much noise , my lords . Sweet prince , speak low ;
The king your father is dispos'd to sleep .

Let us withdraw into the other room .

Will't please your Grace to go along with us ?

No ; I will sit and watch here by the king .

Why doth the crown lie there upon his pillow ,
Being so troublesome a bedfellow ?
O polish'd perturbation , golden care !
That keep'st the ports of slumber open wide 
To many a watchful night , Sleep with it now !
Yet not so sound , and half so deeply sweet 
As he whose brow with homely biggin bound 
Snores out the watch of night . O majesty !
When thou dost pinch thy bearer , thou dost sit 
Like a rich armour worn in heat of day ,
That scalds with safety . By his gates of breath 
There lies a downy feather which stirs not :
Did he suspire , that light and weightless down 
Perforce must move . My gracious lord , my father !
This sleep is sound indeed ; this is a sleep 
That from this golden rigol hath divorc'd 
So many English kings . Thy due from me 
Is tears and heavy sorrows of the blood ,
Which nature , love , and filial tenderness 
Shall , O dear father , pay thee plenteously :
My due from thee is this imperial crown ,
Which , as immediate from thy place and blood ,
Derives itself to me . Lo , here it sits ,

Which heaven shall guard ; and put the world's whole strength 
Into one giant arm , it shall not force 
This lineal honour from me . This from thee 
Will I to mine leave , as 'tis left to me .


Warwick , Gloucester , Clarence !


Doth the king call ?

What would your majesty , How fares your Grace ?

Why did you leave me here alone , my lords ?

We left the prince my brother here , my liege ,
Who undertook to sit and watch by you .

The Prince of Wales , Where is he , let me see him :
He is not here .

This door is open ; he is gone this way .

He came not through the chamber where we stay'd .

Where is the crown , who took it from my pillow ?

When we withdrew , my liege , we left it here .

The prince hath ta'en it hence : go , seek him out .
Is he so hasty that he doth suppose 
My sleep my death ?
Find him , my Lord of Warwick ; chide him hither .

This part of his conjoins with my disease ,
And helps to end me . See , sons , what things you are !
How quickly nature falls into revolt 
When gold becomes her object !
For this the foolish over-careful fathers 
Have broke their sleeps with thoughts ,
Their brains with care , their bones with industry ;
For this they have engrossed and pil'd up 
The canker'd heaps of strange-achieved gold ;
For this they have been thoughtful to invest 
Their sons with arts and martial exercises :
When , like the bee , culling from every flower 
The virtuous sweets ,
Our thighs packed with wax , our mouths with honey ,
We bring it to the hive , and like the bees ,
Are murder'd for our pains . This bitter taste 
Yield his engrossments to the ending father .


Now , where is he that will not stay so long 

Till his friend sickness hath determin'd me ?

My lord , I found the prince in the next room ,
Washing with kindly tears his gentle cheeks ,
With such a deep demeanour in great sorrow 
That tyranny , which never quaff'd but blood ,
Would , by beholding him , have wash'd his knife 
With gentle eye-drops . He is coming hither .

But wherefore did he take away the crown ?


Lo , where he comes . Come hither to me , Harry .
Depart the chamber , leave us here alone .

I never thought to hear you speak again .

Thy wish was father , Harry , to that thought :
I stay too long by thee , I weary thee .
Dost thou so hunger for my empty chair 
That thou wilt needs invest thee with mine honours 
Before thy hour be ripe , O foolish youth !
Thou seek'st the greatness that will overwhelm thee .
Stay but a little ; for my cloud of dignity 
Is held from falling with so weak a wind 
That it will quickly drop : my day is dim .
Thou hast stol'n that which after some few hours 
Were thine without offence ; and at my death 
Thou hast seal'd up my expectation :
Thy life did manifest thou lov'dst me not ,
And thou wilt have me die assur'd of it .
Thou hid'st a thousand daggers in thy thoughts ,
Which thou hast whetted on thy stony heart ,
To stab at half an hour of my life .
What , canst thou not forbear me half an hour ?
Then get thee gone and dig my grave thyself ,
And bid the merry bells ring to thine ear 
That thou art crowned , not that I am dead .
Let all the tears that should bedew my hearse 
Be drops of balm to sanctify thy head :
Only compound me with forgotten dust ;
Give that which gave thee life unto the worms .
Pluck down my officers , break my decrees ;
For now a time is come to mock at form .
Harry the Fifth is crown'd , Up , vanity !
Down , royal state , all you sage counsellors , hence !
And to the English court assemble now ,
From every region , apes of idleness !
Now , neighbour confines , purge you of your scum :
Have you a ruffian that will swear , drink , dance ,
Revel the night , rob , murder , and commit 
The oldest sins the newest kind of ways ?
Be happy , he will trouble you no more :
England shall double gild his treble guilt .
England shall give him office , honour , might ;
For the fifth Harry from curb'd licence plucks 
The muzzle of restraint , and the wild dog 
Shall flesh his tooth in every innocent .
O my poor kingdom , sick with civil blows .
When that my care could not withhold thy riots ,
What wilt thou do when riot is thy care ?
O , thou wilt be a wilderness again ,
Peopled with wolves , thy old inhabitants .

O , pardon me , my liege ; but for my tears ,
The moist impediments unto my speech ,
I had forestall'd this dear and deep rebuke 
Ere you with grief had spoke and I had heard 
The course of it so far . There is your crown ;
And he that wears the crown immortally 
Long guard it yours , If I affect it more 
Than as your honour and as your renown ,
Let me no more from this obedience rise ,
Which my most true and inward duteous spirit 
Teacheth ,this prostrate and exterior bending .
God witness with me , when I here came in ,
And found no course of breath within your majesty ,
How cold it struck my heart , if I do feign ,
O , let me in my present wildness die 
And never live to show the incredulous world 
The noble change that I have purposed .
Coming to look on you , thinking you dead ,
And dead almost , my liege , to think you were ,
I spake unto the crown as having sense ,
And thus upbraided it : 'The care on thee depending 
Hath fed upon the body of my father ;
Therefore , thou best of gold art worst of gold :
Other , less fine in carat , is more precious ,
Preserving life in medicine potable :
But thou most fine , most honour'd , most renown'd ,
Hast eat thy bearer up .' Thus , my most royal liege ,
Accusing it , I put it on my head ,
To try with it , as with an enemy 
That had before my face murder'd my father ,
The quarrel of a true inheritor .
But if it did infect my blood with joy ,
Or swell my thoughts to any strain of pride ;
If any rebel or vain spirit of mine 
Did with the least affection of a welcome 
Give entertainment to the might of it ,
Let God for ever keep it from my head ,
And make me as the poorest vassal is 
That doth with awe and terror kneel to it !

O my son !
God put it in thy mind to take it hence ,
That thou mightst win the more thy father's love ,
Pleading so wisely in excuse of it .
Come hither , Harry : sit thou by my bed ;
And hear , I think , the very latest counsel 
That ever I shall breathe . God knows , my son ,
By what by-paths and indirect crook'd ways 
I met this crown ; and I myself know well 
How troublesome it sat upon my head :
To thee it shall descend with better quiet ,
Better opinion , better confirmation ;
For all the soil of the achievement goes 
With me into the earth . It seem'd in me 
But as an honour snatch'd with boisterous hand ,
And I had many living to upbraid 
My gain of it by their assistances ;
Which daily grew to quarrel and to bloodshed ,
Wounding supposed peace . All these bold fears 
Thou seest with peril I have answered ;
For all my reign hath been but as a scene 
Acting that argument ; and now my death 
Changes the mode : for what in me was purchas'd ,
Falls upon thee in a more fairer sort ;
So thou the garment wear'st successively .
Yet , though thou stand'st more sure than I could do ,
Thou art not firm enough , since griefs are green ;
And all my friends , which thou must make thy friends ,
Have but their stings and teeth newly ta'en out ;
By whose fell working I was first advanc'd ,
And by whose power I well might lodge a fear 
To be again displac'd : which to avoid ,
I cut them off ; and had a purpose now 
To lead out many to the Holy Land ,
Lest rest and lying still might make them look 
Too near unto my state . Therefore , my Harry ,
Be it thy course to busy giddy minds 
With foreign quarrels ; that action , hence borne out ,
May waste the memory of the former days .
More would I , but my lungs are wasted so 
That strength of speech is utterly denied me .
How I came by the crown , O God , forgive !
And grant it may with thee in true peace live .

My gracious liege ,
You won it , wore it , kept it , gave it me ;
Then plain and right must my possession be :
Which I with more than with a common pain 
'Gainst all the world will rightfully maintain .


Look , look , here comes my John of Lancaster .

Health , peace , and happiness to my royal father !

Thou bring'st me happiness and peace , son John ;
But health , alack , with youthful wings is flown 
From this bare wither'd trunk : upon thy sight 
My worldly business makes a period .
Where is my Lord of Warwick ?

My Lord of Warwick !


Doth any name particular belong 
Unto the lodging where I first did swound ?

'Tis call'd Jerusalem , my noble lord .

Laud be to God , even there my life must end .
It hath been prophesied to me many years 
I should not die but in Jerusalem ,
Which vainly I suppos'd the Holy Land .
But bear me to that chamber ; there I'll lie :
In that Jerusalem shall Harry die .

By cock and pie , sir , you shall not away to-night . What , Davy , I say .

You must excuse me , Master Robert Shallow .

I will not excuse you ; you shall not be excused ; excuses shall not be admitted ; there is no excuse shall serve ; you shall not be excused . Why , Davy !


Here , sir .

Davy , Davy , Davy , Davy , let me see , Davy ; let me see : yea , marry , William cook , bid him come hither . Sir John , you shall not be excused .

Marry , sir , thus ; those precepts cannot be served : and again , sir , shall we sow the headland with wheat ?

With red wheat , Davy . But for William cook : are there no young pigeons ?

Yes , sir . Here is now the smith's note for shoeing and plough-irons .

Let it be cast and paid . Sir John , you shall not be excused .

Now , sir , a new link to the bucket must needs be had : and , sir , do you mean to stop any of William's wages , about the sack he lost the other day at Hinckley fair ?

A' shall answer it . Some pigeons , Davy , a couple of short-legged hens , a joint of mutton , and any pretty little tiny kickshaws , tell William cook .

Doth the man of war stay all night , sir ?

Yea , Davy . I will use him well . A friend i' the court is better than a penny in purse . Use his men well , Davy , for they are arrant knaves , and will backbite .

No worse than they are back-bitten , sir ; for they have marvellous foul linen .

Well conceited , Davy : about thy business , Davy .

I beseech you , sir , to countenance William Visor of Wincot against Clement Perkes of the hill .

There are many complaints , Davy , against that Visor : that Visor is an arrant knave , on my knowledge .

I grant your worship that he is a knave , sir ; but yet , God forbid , sir , but a knave should have some countenance at his friend's request . An honest man , sir , is able to speak for himself , when a knave is not . I have served your worship truly , sir , this eight years ; and if I cannot once or twice in a quarter bear out a knave against an honest man , I have but a very little credit with your worship . The knave is mine honest friend , sir ; therefore , I beseech your worship , let him be countenanced .

Go to ; I say he shall have no wrong . Look about , Davy .

Where are you , Sir John , Come , come , come ; off with your boots . Give me your hand , Master Bardolph .

I am glad to see your worship .

I thank thee with all my heart , kind Master Bardolph :

and welcome , my tall fellow . Come , Sir John .

I'll follow you , good Master Robert Shallow .

If I were sawed into quantities , I should make four dozen of such bearded hermit's staves as Master Shallow . It is a wonderful thing to see the semblable coherence of his men's spirits and his : they , by observing him , do bear themselves like foolish justices ; he , by conversing with them , is turned into a justice-like serving-man . Their spirits are so married in conjunction with the participation of society that they flock together in consent , like so many wild-geese . If I had a suit to Master Shallow , I would humour his men with the imputation of being near their master : if to his men , I would curry with Master Shallow that no man could better command his servants . It is certain that either wise bearing or ignorant carriage is caught , as men take diseases , one of another : therefore let men take heed of their company . I will devise matter enough out of this Shallow to keep Prince Harry in continual laughter the wearing out of six fashions ,which is four terms , or two actions ,and a' shall laugh without intervallums . O , it is much that a lie with a slight oath and a jest with a sad brow will do with a fellow that never had the ache in his shoulders . O , you shall see him laugh till his face be like a wet cloak ill laid up !

Sir John !

I come , Master Shallow : I come , Master Shallow .


How now , my Lord Chief Justice , whither away ?

How doth the king ?

Exceeding well : his cares are now all ended .

I hope not dead .

He's walk'd the way of nature ;
And to our purposes he lives no more .

I would his majesty had call'd me with him :
The service that I truly did his life 
Hath left me open to all injuries .

Indeed I think the young king loves you not .

I know he doth not , and do arm myself ,
To welcome the condition of the time ;
Which cannot look more hideously upon me 
Than I have drawn it in my fantasy .


Here come the heavy issue of dead Harry :
O , that the living Harry had the temper 
Of him , the worst of these three gentlemen .
How many nobles then should hold their places ,
That must strike sail to spirits of vile sort !

O God , I fear all will be overturn'd .

Good morrow , cousin Warwick , good morrow .

Good morrow , cousin .

Good morrow , cousin .

We meet like men that had forgot to speak .

We do remember ; but our argument 
Is all too heavy to admit much talk .

Well , peace be with him that hath made us heavy !

Peace be with us , lest we be heavier !

O , good my lord , you have lost a friend indeed ;
And I dare swear you borrow not that face 
Of seeming sorrow ; it is sure your own .

Though no man be assur'd what grace to find ,
You stand in coldest expectation .
I am the sorrier ; would 'twere otherwise .

Well , you must now speak Sir John Falstaff fair ,
Which swims against your stream of quality .

Sweet princes , what I did , I did in honour ,
Led by the impartial conduct of my soul ;
And never shall you see that I will beg 
A ragged and forestall'd remission .
If truth and upright innocency fail me ,
I'll to the king my master that is dead ,
And tell him who hath sent me after him .

Here comes the prince .


Good morrow , and God save your majesty !

This new and gorgeous garment , majesty ,
Sits not so easy on me as you think .
Brothers , you mix your sadness with some fear :
This is the English , not the Turkish court ;
Not Amurath an Amurath succeeds ,
But Harry Harry . Yet be sad , good brothers ,
For , to speak truth , it very well becomes you :
Sorrow so royally in you appears 
That I will deeply put the fashion on 
And wear it in my heart . Why then , be sad ;
But entertain no more of it , good brothers ,
Than a joint burden laid upon us all .
For me , by heaven , I bid you be assur'd ,
I'll be your father and your brother too ;
Let me but bear your love , I'll bear your cares :
Yet weep that Harry's dead , and so will I ;
But Harry lives that shall convert those tears 
By number into hours of happiness .

We hope no other from your majesty .

You all look strangely on me :

and you most ;
You are , I think , assur'd I love you not .

I am assur'd , if I be measur'd rightly ,
Your majesty hath no just cause to hate me .

No !
How might a prince of my great hopes forget 
So great indignities you laid upon me ?
What , rate , rebuke , and roughly send to prison 
The immediate heir of England , Was this easy ?
May this be wash'd in Lethe , and forgotten ?

I then did use the person of your father ;
The image of his power lay then in me :
And , in the administration of his law ,
Whiles I was busy for the commonwealth ,
Your highness pleased to forget my place ,
The majesty and power of law and justice ,
The image of the king whom I presented ,
And struck me in my very seat of judgment ;
Whereon , as an offender to your father ,
I gave bold way to my authority ,
And did commit you . If the deed were ill ,
Be you contented , wearing now the garland ,
To have a son set your decrees at nought ,
To pluck down justice from your awful bench ,
To trip the course of law , and blunt the sword 
That guards the peace and safety of your person :
Nay , more , to spurn at your most royal image 
And mock your workings in a second body .
Question your royal thoughts , make the case yours ;
Be now the father and propose a son ,
Hear your own dignity so much profan'd ,
See your most dreadful laws so loosely slighted ,
Behold yourself so by a son disdain'd ;
And then imagine me taking your part ,
And in your power soft silencing your son :
After this cold considerance , sentence me ;
And , as you are a king , speak in your state 
What I have done that misbecame my place ,
My person , or my liege's sov'reignty .

You are right , justice ; and you weigh this well ;
Therefore still bear the balance and the sword :
And I do wish your honours may increase 
Till you do live to see a son of mine 
Offend you and obey you , as I did .
So shall I live to speak my father's words :
'Happy am I , that have a man so bold 
That dares do justice on my proper son ;
And not less happy , having such a son ,
That would deliver up his greatness so 
Into the hands of justice .' You did commit me :
For which , I do commit into your hand 
The unstained sword that you have us'd to bear ;
With this remembrance , that you use the same 
With the like bold , just , and impartial spirit 
As you have done 'gainst me . There is my hand :
You shall be as a father to my youth ;
My voice shall sound as you do prompt mine ear ,
And I will stoop and humble my intents 
To your well-practis'd wise directions .
And , princes all , believe me , I beseech you ;
My father is gone wild into his grave ,
For in his tomb lie my affections ;
And with his spirit sadly I survive ,
To mock the expectation of the world ,
To frustrate prophecies , and to raze out 
Rotten opinion , who hath writ me down 
After my seeming . The tide of blood in me 
Hath proudly flow'd in vanity till now :
Now doth it turn and ebb back to the sea ,
Where it shall mingle with the state of floods 
And flow henceforth in formal majesty .
Now call we our high court of parliament ;
And let us choose such limbs of noble counsel ,
That the great body of our state may go 
In equal rank with the best govern'd nation ;
That war or peace , or both at once , may be 
As things acquainted and familiar to us ;
In which you , father , shall have foremost hand .
Our coronation done , we will accite ,
As I before remember'd , all our state :
And , God consigning to my good intents ,
No prince nor peer shall have just cause to say ,
God shorten Harry's happy life one day .


Nay , you shall see mine orchard , where , in an arbour , we will eat a last year's pippin of my own graffing , with a dish of caraways , and so forth ; come , cousin Silence ; and then to bed .

'Fore God , you have here a goodly dwelling , and a rich .

Barren , barren , barren ; beggars all , beggars all , Sir John : marry , good air . Spread , Davy ; spread , Davy : well said , Davy .

This Davy serves you for good uses ; he is your serving-man and your husband .

A good varlet , a good varlet , a very good varlet , Sir John : by the mass , I have drunk too much sack at supper : a good varlet . Now sit down , now sit down . Come , cousin .

Ah , sirrah , quoth a' , we shall 

Do nothing but eat , and make good cheer ,
And praise God for the merry year ;
When flesh is cheap and females dear ,
And lusty lads roam here and there ,
So merrily 
And ever among so merrily .


There's a merry heart , Good Master Silence , I'll give you a health for that anon .

Give Master Bardolph some wine , Davy .

Sweet sir , sit ; I'll be with you anon : most sweet sir , sit . Master page , good master page , sit . Proface , What you want in meat we'll have in drink : but you must bear : the heart's all .


Be merry , Master Bardolph ; and my little soldier there , be merry .


Be merry , be merry , my wife has all ;
For women are shrews , both short and tall :
'Tis merry in hall when beards wag all ,
And welcome merry Shrove-tide .
Be merry , be merry .


I did not think Master Silence had been a man of this mettle .

Who , I , I have been merry twice and once ere now .


There's a dish of leather-coats for you .


Davy !

Your worship , I'll be with you straight . A cup of wine , sir ?


A cup of wine that's brisk and fine 
And drink unto the leman mine ;
And a merry heart lives long-a .


Well said , Master Silence .

And we shall be merry , now comes in the sweet o' the night .

Health and long life to you , Master Silence .


Fill the cup , and let it come ;
I'll pledge you a mile to the bottom .


Honest Bardolph , welcome : if thou wantest anything and wilt not call , beshrew thy heart .

Welcome , my little tiny thief ; and welcome indeed too . I'll drink to Master Bardolph and to all the cavaleiroes about London .

I hope to see London once ere I die .

An I might see you there , Davy ,

By the mass , you'll crack a quart together : ha , will you not , Master Bardolph ?

Yea , sir , in a pottle-pot .

By God's liggens , I thank thee . The knave will stick by thee , I can assure thee that : a' will not out ; he is true bred .

And I'll stick by him , sir .

Why , there spoke a king . Lack nothing : be merry .

Look who's at door there . Ho , who knocks ?

Why , now you have done me right .


Do me right ,
And dub me knight :
Samingo 

Is't not so ?

'Tis so .

Is't so , Why , then , say an old man can do somewhat .


An't please your worship , there's one Pistol come from the court with news .

From the court , let him come in .

How now , Pistol !

Sir John , God save you , sir !

What wind blew you hither , Pistol ?

Not the ill wind which blows no man to good .
Sweet knight , thou art now one of the greatest men in this realm .

By'r lady , I think a' be , but goodman Puff of Barson .

Puff !
Puff in thy teeth , most recreant coward base !
Sir John , I am thy Pistol and thy friend ,
And helter-skelter have I rode to thee ,
And tidings do I bring and lucky joys 
And golden times and happy news of price .

I prithee now , deliver them like a man of this world .

A foutra for the world and worldlings base !
I speak of Africa and golden joys .

O base Assyrian knight , what is thy news ?
Let King Cophetua know the truth thereof .


And Robin Hood , Scarlet , and John .


Shall dunghill curs confront the Helicons ?
And shall good news be baffled ?
Then , Pistol , lay thy head in Furies' lap .

Honest gentleman , I know not your breeding .

Why then , lament therefore .

Give me pardon , sir : if , sir , you come with news from the court , I take it there is but two ways : either to utter them , or to conceal them . I am , sir , under the king , in some authority .

Under which king , Bezonian , speak , or die .

Under King Harry .

Harry the Fourth , or Fifth ?

Harry the Fourth .

A foutra for thine office !
Sir John , thy tender lambkin now is king ;
Harry the Fifth's the man . I speak the truth :
When Pistol lies , do this ; and fig me , like 
The bragging Spaniard .

What , is the old king dead ?

As nail in door : the things I speak are just .

Away , Bardolph , saddle my horse . Master Robert Shallow , choose what office thou wilt in the land , 'tis thine . Pistol , I will double-charge thee with dignities .

O joyful day !
I would not take a knighthood for my fortune .

What , I do bring good news .

Carry Master Silence to bed . Master Shallow , my Lord Shallow , be what thou wilt , I am Fortune's steward . Get on thy boots : we'll ride all night . O sweet Pistol , Away , Bardolph !

Come , Pistol , utter more to me ; and , withal devise something to do thyself good . Boot , boot , Master Shallow : I know the young king is sick for me . Let us take any man's horses ; the laws of England are at my commandment . Happy are they which have been my friends , and woe unto my lord chief justice !

Let vultures vile seize on his lungs also !
'Where is the life that late I led ?' say they :
Why , here it is : welcome these pleasant days !


No , thou arrant knave : I would to God I might die that I might have thee hanged ; thou hast drawn my shoulder out of joint .

The constables have delivered her over to me , and she shall have whipping-cheer enough , I warrant her : there hath been a man or two lately killed about her .

Nut-hook , nut-hook , you lie . Come on ; I'll tell thee what , thou damned tripe-visaged rascal , an the child I now go with do miscarry , thou hadst better thou hadst struck thy mother , thou paper-faced villain .

O the Lord , that Sir John were come ; he would make this a bloody day to somebody . But I pray God the fruit of her womb miscarry !

If it do , you shall have a dozen of cushions again ; you have but eleven now . Come , I charge you both go with me ; for the man is dead that you and Pistol beat among you .

I'll tell thee what , thou thin man in a censer , I will have you as soundly swinged for this , you blue-bottle rogue , you filthy famished correctioner , if you be not swinged , I'll forswear half-kirtles .

Come , come , you she knighterrant , come .

O , that right should thus overcome might , Well , of sufferance comes ease .

Come , you rogue , come : bring me to a justice .

Ay ; come , you starved blood-hound .

Goodman death , goodman bones !

Thou atomy , thou !

Come , you thin thing ; come , you rascal !

Very well .


More rushes , more rushes .

The trumpets have sounded twice .

It will be two o'clock ere they come from the coronation . Dispatch , dispatch .

Stand here by me , Master Robert Shallow ; I will make the king do you grace . I will leer upon him , as a' comes by ; and do but mark the countenance that he will give me .

God bless thy lungs , good knight .

Come here , Pistol ; stand behind me . O , if I had had time to have made new liveries , I would have bestowed the thousand pound I borrowed of you . But 'tis no matter ; this poor show doth better : this doth infer the zeal I had to see him .

It doth so .

It shows my earnestness of affection .

It doth so .

My devotion .

It doth , it doth , it doth .

As it were , to ride day and night ; and not to deliberate , not to remember , not to have patience to shift me .

It is most certain .

But to stand stained with travel , and sweating with desire to see him ; thinking of nothing else ; putting all affairs else in oblivion , as if there were nothing else to be done but to see him .

'Tis semper idem , for absque hoc nihil est :
'Tis all in every part .

'Tis so , indeed .

My knight , I will inflame thy noble liver ,
And make thee rage .
Thy Doll , and Helen of thy noble thoughts ,
Is in base durance and contagious prison ;
Hal'd thither 
By most mechanical and dirty hand :
Rouse up revenge from ebon den with fell Alecto's snake ,
For Doll is in : Pistol speaks nought but truth .

I will deliver her .


There roar'd the sea , and trumpetclangor sounds .


God save thy grace , King Hal , my royal Hal !

The heavens thee guard and keep , most royal imp of fame !

God save thee , my sweet boy !

My lord chief justice , speak to that vain man .

Have you your wits , know you what 'tis you speak ?

My king , my Jove , I speak to thee , my heart !

I know thee not , old man : fall to thy prayers ;
How ill white hairs become a fool and jester !
I have long dream'd of such a kind of man ,
So surfeit-swell'd , so old , and so profane ;
But , being awak'd , I do despise my dream .
Make less thy body hence , and more thy grace ;
Leave gormandising ; know the grave doth gape 
For thee thrice wider than for other men .
Reply not to me with a fool-born jest :
Presume not that I am the thing I was ;
For God doth know , so shall the world perceive ,
That I have turn'd away my former self ;
So will I those that kept me company .
When thou dost hear I am as I have been ,
Approach me , and thou shalt be as thou wast ,
The tutor and the feeder of my riots :
Till then , I banish thee , on pain of death ,
As I have done the rest of my misleaders ,
Not to come near our person by ten mile .
For competence of life I will allow you ,
That lack of means enforce you not to evil :
And , as we hear you do reform yourselves ,
We will , according to your strength and qualities ,
Give you advancement . Be it your charge , my lord ,
To see perform'd the tenour of our word .
Set on .


Master Shallow , I owe you a thousand pound .

Ay , marry , Sir John ; which I beseech you to let me have home with me .

That can hardly be , Master Shallow . Do not you grieve at this : I shall be sent for in private to him . Look you , he must seem thus to the world . Fear not your advancements ; I will be the man yet that shall make you great .

I cannot perceive how , unless you should give me your doublet and stuff me out with straw . I beseech you , good Sir John , let me have five hundred of my thousand .

Sir , I will be as good as my word : this that you heard was but a colour .

A colour that I fear you will die in , Sir John .

Fear no colours : go with me to dinner . Come , Lieutenant Pistol ; come , Bardolph : I shall be sent for soon at night .


Go , carry Sir John Falstaff to the Fleet ;
Take all his company along with him .

My lord , my lord !

I cannot now speak : I will hear you soon .
Take them away .

Si fortuna me tormenta , spero contenta .


I like this fair proceeding of the king's .
He hath intent his wonted followers 
Shall all be very well provided for ;
But all are banish'd till their conversations 
Appear more wise and modest to the world .

And so they are .

The king hath call'd his parliament , my lord .

He hath .

I will lay odds , that , ere this year expire ,
We bear our civil swords and native fire 
As far as France . I heard a bird so sing ,
Whose music , to my thinking , pleas'd the king .
Come , will you hence ?


First , my fear ; then , my curtsy ; last my speech . My fear is , your displeasure , my curtsy , my duty , and my speech , to beg your pardon . If you look for a good speech now , you undo me ; for what I have to say is of mine own making ; and what indeed I should say will , I doubt , prove mine own marring . But to the purpose , and so to the venture . Be it known to you ,as it is very well ,I was lately here in the end of a displeasing play , to pray your patience for it and to promise you a better . I did mean indeed to pay you with this ; which , if like an ill venture it come unluckily home , I break , and you , my gentle creditors , lose . Here , I promised you I would be , and here I commit my body to your mercies : bate me some and I will pay you some ; and , as most debtors do , promise you infinitely .
If my tongue cannot entreat you to acquit me , will you command me to use my legs , and yet that were but light payment , to dance out of your debt . But a good conscience will make any possible satisfaction , and so will I . All the gentlewomen here have forgiven me : if the gentlemen will not , then the gentlemen do not agree with the gentlewomen , which was never seen before in such an assembly .
One word more , I beseech you . If you be not too much cloyed with fat meat , our humble author will continue the story , with Sir John in it , and make you merry with fair Katharine of France : where , for anything I know , Falstaff shall die of a sweat , unless already a' be killed with your hard opinions ; for Oldcastle died a martyr , and this is not the man . My tongue is weary ; when my legs are too , I will bid you good night : and so kneel down before you ; but , indeed , to pray for the queen .

THE SECOND PART OF KING HENRY VI

 
As by your high imperial majesty 
I had in charge at my depart for France ,
As procurator to your excellence ,
To marry Princess Margaret for your Grace ;
So , in the famous ancient city , Tours ,
In presence of the Kings of France and Sicil ,
The Dukes of Orleans , Calaber , Britaine , and Alen on ,
Seven earls , twelve barons , and twenty reverend bishops ,
I have perform'd my task , and was espous'd :
And humbly now upon my bended knee ,
In sight of England and her lordly peers ,
Deliver up my title in the queen 
To your most gracious hands , that are the substance 
Of that great shadow I did represent ;
The happiest gift that ever marquess gave ,
The fairest queen that ever king receiv'd .

Suffolk , arise . Welcome , Queen Margaret :
I can express no kinder sign of love 
Than this kind kiss . O Lord , that lends me life ,
Lend me a heart replete with thankfulness !
For thou hast given me in this beauteous face 
A world of earthly blessings to my soul ,
If sympathy of love unite our thoughts .

Great King of England and my gracious lord ,
The mutual conference that my mind hath had 
By day , by night , waking , and in my dreams ,
In courtly company , or at my beads ,
With you , mine alderliefest sovereign ,
Makes me the bolder to salute my king 
With ruder terms , such as my wit affords ,
And over-joy of heart doth minister .

Her sight did ravish , but her grace in speech ,
Her words y-clad with wisdom's majesty ,
Makes me from wondering fall to weeping joys ;
Such is the fulness of my heart's content .
Lords , with one cheerful voice welcome my love .

Long live Queen Margaret , England's happiness !

We thank you all .


My Lord Protector , so it please your Grace ,
Here are the articles of contracted peace 
Between our sovereign and the French King Charles ,
For eighteen months concluded by consent .

Imprimis , It is agreed between the French king , Charles , and William De la Pole , Marquess of Suffolk , ambassador for Henry King of England , that the said Henry shall espouse the Lady Margaret , daughter unto Reignier King of Naples , Sicilia , and Jerusalem , and crown her Queen of England ere the thirtieth of May next ensuing .
Item , That the duchy of Anjou and the county of Maine shall be released and delivered to the king her father .


Uncle , how now !

Pardon me , gracious lord ;
Some sudden qualm hath struck me at the heart 
And dimm'd mine eyes , that I can read no further .

Uncle of Winchester , I pray , read on .

Item , It is further agreed between them , that the duchies of Anjou and Maine shall be released and delivered over to the king her father ; and she sent over of the King of England's own proper cost and charges , without having any dowry .

They please us well . Lord marquess , kneel down :
We here create thee the first Duke of Suffolk ,
And girt thee with the sword . Cousin of York ,
We here discharge your Grace from being regent 
I' the parts of France , till term of eighteen months 
Be full expir'd . Thanks , uncle Winchester ,
Gloucester , York , Buckingham , Somerset ,
Salisbury , and Warwick ;
We thank you all for this great favour done ,
In entertainment to my princely queen .
Come , let us in , and with all speed provide 
To see her coronation be perform'd .


Brave peers of England , pillars of the state ,
To you Duke Humphrey must unload his grief ,
Your grief , the common grief of all the land .
What , did my brother Henry spend his youth ,
His valour , coin , and people , in the wars ?
Did he so often lodge in open field ,
In winter's cold , and summer's parching heat ,
To conquer France , his true inheritance ?
And did my brother Bedford toil his wits ,
To keep by policy what Henry got ?
Have you yourselves , Somerset , Buckingham ,
Brave York , Salisbury , and victorious Warwick ,
Receiv'd deep scars in France and Normandy ?
Or hath mine uncle Beaufort and myself ,
With all the learned council of the realm ,
Studied so long , sat in the council-house 
Early and late , debating to and fro 
How France and Frenchmen might be kept in awe ?
And hath his highness in his infancy 
Been crown'd in Paris , in despite of foes ?
And shall these labours and these honours die ?
Shall Henry's conquest , Bedford's vigilance ,
Your deeds of war and all our counsel die ?
O peers of England , shameful is this league ,
Fatal this marriage , cancelling your fame ,
Blotting your names from books of memory ,
Razing the characters of your renown ,
Defacing monuments of conquer'd France ,
Undoing all , as all had never been .

Nephew , what means this passionate discourse ,
This peroration with such circumstance ?
For France , 'tis ours ; and we will keep it still .

Ay , uncle ; we will keep it , if we can ;
But now it is impossible we should .
Suffolk , the new-made duke that rules the roast ,
Hath given the duchies of Anjou and Maine 
Unto the poor King Reignier , whose large style 
Agrees not with the leanness of his purse .

Now , by the death of him who died for all ,
These counties were the keys of Normandy .
But wherefore weeps Warwick , my valiant son ?

For grief that they are past recovery :
For , were there hope to conquer them again ,
My sword should shed hot blood , mine eyes no tears .
Anjou and Maine , myself did win them both ;
Those provinces these arms of mine did conquer :
And are the cities , that I got with wounds ,
Deliver'd up again with peaceful words ?
Mort Dieu !

For Suffolk's duke , may he be suffocate ,
That dims the honour of this war-like isle !
France should have torn and rent my very heart 
Before I would have yielded to this league .
I never read but England's kings have had 
Large sums of gold and dowries with their wives ;
And our King Henry gives away his own ,
To match with her that brings no vantages .

A proper jest , and never heard before ,
That Suffolk should demand a whole fifteenth 
For costs and charges in transporting her !
She should have stay'd in France , and starv'd in France ,
Before 

My Lord of Gloucester , now you grow too hot :
It was the pleasure of my lord the king .

My Lord of Winchester , I know your mind :
'Tis not my speeches that you do mislike ,
But 'tis my presence that doth trouble ye .
Rancour will out : proud prelate , in thy face 
I see thy fury . If I longer stay 
We shall begin our ancient bickerings .
Lordings , farewell ; and say , when I am gone ,
I prophesied France will be lost ere long .


So , there goes our protector in a rage .
'Tis known to you he is mine enemy ,
Nay , more , an enemy unto you all ,
And no great friend , I fear me , to the king .
Consider lords , he is the next of blood ,
And heir apparent to the English crown :
Had Henry got an empire by his marriage ,
And all the wealthy kingdoms of the west ,
There's reason he should be displeas'd at it .
Look to it , lords ; let not his smoothing words 
Bewitch your hearts ; be wise and circumspect .
What though the common people favour him ,
Calling him , 'Humphrey , the good Duke of Gloucester ;' 
Clapping their hands , and crying with loud voice ,
'Jesu maintain your royal excellence !' 
With 'God preserve the good Duke Humphrey !' 
I fear me , lords , for all this flattering gloss ,
He will be found a dangerous protector .

Why should he then protect our sovereign ,
He being of age to govern of himself ?
Cousin of Somerset , join you with me ,
And all together , with the Duke of Suffolk ,
We'll quickly hoise Duke Humphrey from his seat .

This weighty business will not brook delay ;
I'll to the Duke of Suffolk presently .


Cousin of Buckingham , though Humphrey's pride 
And greatness of his place be grief to us ,
Yet let us watch the haughty cardinal :
His insolence is more intolerable 
Than all the princes in the land beside :
If Gloucester be displac'd , he'll be protector .

Or thou , or I , Somerset , will be protector ,
Despite Duke Humphrey or the cardinal .


Pride went before , ambition follows him .
While these do labour for their own preferment ,
Behoves it us to labour for the realm .
I never saw but Humphrey , Duke of Gloucester ,
Did bear him like a noble gentleman .
Oft have I seen the haughty cardinal 
More like a soldier than a man o' the church ,
As stout and proud as he were lord of all ,
Swear like a ruffian and demean himself 
Unlike the ruler of a commonweal .
Warwick , my son , the comfort of my age ,
Thy deeds , thy plainness , and thy house-keeping ,
Have won the greatest favour of the commons ,
Excepting none but good Duke Humphrey :
And , brother York , thy acts in Ireland ,
In bringing them to civil discipline ,
Thy late exploits done in the heart of France ,
When thou wert regent for our sovereign ,
Have made thee fear'd and honour'd of the people .
Join we together for the public good ,
In what we can to bridle and suppress 
The pride of Suffolk and the cardinal ,
With Somerset's and Buckingham's ambition ;
And , as we may , cherish Duke Humphrey's deeds ,
While they do tend the profit of the land .

So God help Warwick , as he loves the land ,
And common profit of his country !

And so says York , for he hath greatest cause .

Then let's make haste away , and look unto the main .

Unto the main , O father , Maine is lost !
That Maine which by main force Warwick did win ,
And would have kept so long as breath did last :
Main chance , father , you meant ; but I meant Maine ,
Which I will win from France , or else be slain .


Anjou and Maine are given to the French ;
Paris is lost ; the state of Normandy 
Stands on a tickle point now they are gone .
Suffolk concluded on the articles ,
The peers agreed , and Henry was well pleas'd 
To change two dukedoms for a duke's fair daughter .
I cannot blame them all : what is't to them ?
'Tis thine they give away , and not their own .
Pirates may make cheap pennyworths of their pillage ,
And purchase friends , and give to courtezans ,
Still revelling like lords till all be gone ;
While as the silly owner of the goods 
Weeps over them , and wrings his hapless hands ,
And shakes his head , and trembling stands aloof ,
While all is shar'd and all is borne away ,
Ready to starve and dare not touch his own :
So York must sit and fret and bite his tongue 
While his own lands are bargain'd for and sold .
Methinks the realms of England , France , and Ireland 
Bear that proportion to my flesh and blood 
As did the fatal brand Alth a burn'd 
Unto the prince's heart of Calydon .
Anjou and Maine both given unto the French !
Cold news for me , for I had hope of France ,
Even as I have of fertile England's soil .
A day will come when York shall claim his own ;
And therefore I will take the Nevils' parts 
And make a show of love to proud Duke Humphrey ,
And , when I spy advantage , claim the crown ,
For that's the golden mark I seek to hit .
Nor shall proud Lancaster usurp my right .
Nor hold the sceptre in his childish fist ,
Nor wear the diadem upon his head ,
Whose church-like humours fit not for a crown .
Then , York , be still awhile , till time do serve :
Watch thou and wake when others be asleep ,
To pry into the secrets of the state ;
Till Henry , surfeiting in joys of love ,
With his new bride and England's dear-bought queen ,
And Humphrey with the peers be fall'n at jars :
Then will I raise aloft the milk-white rose ,
With whose sweet smell the air shall be perfum'd ,
And in my standard bear the arms of York ,
To grapple with the house of Lancaster ;
And , force perforce , I'll make him yield the crown ,
Whose bookish rule hath pull'd fair England down .


Why droops my lord , like over-ripen'd corn 
Hanging the head at Ceres' plenteous load ?
Why doth the great Duke Humphrey knit his brows ,
As frowning at the favours of the world ?
Why are thine eyes fix'd to the sullen earth ,
Gazing on that which seems to dim thy sight ?
What seest thou there , King Henry's diadem 
Enchas'd with all the honours of the world ?
If so , gaze on , and grovel on thy face ,
Until thy head be circled with the same .
Put forth thy hand , reach at the glorious gold :
What , is't too short , I'll lengthen it with mine ;
And having both together heav'd it up ,
We'll both together lift our heads to heaven ,
And never more abase our sight so low 
As to vouchsafe one glance unto the ground .

O Nell , sweet Nell , if thou dost love thy lord ,
Banish the canker of ambitious thoughts :
And may that thought , when I imagine ill 
Against my king and nephew , virtuous Henry ,
Be my last breathing in this mortal world !
My troublous dream this night doth make me sad .

What dream'd my lord , tell me , and I'll requite it 
With sweet rehearsal of my morning's dream .

Methought this staff , mine office-badge in court ,
Was broke in twain ; by whom I have forgot ,
But , as I think , it was by the cardinal ;
And on the pieces of the broken wand 
Were plac'd the heads of Edmund Duke of Somerset ,
And William De la Pole , first Duke of Suffolk .
This was my dream : what it doth bode , God knows .

Tut , this was nothing but an argument 
That he that breaks a stick of Gloucester's grove 
Shall lose his head for his presumption .
But list to me , my Humphrey , my sweet duke :
Methought I sat in seat of majesty 
In the cathedral church of Westminster ,
And in that chair where kings and queens are crown'd ;
Where Henry and Dame Margaret kneel'd to me ,
And on my head did set the diadem .

Nay , Eleanor , then must I chide outright :
Presumptuous dame , ill-nurtur'd Eleanor !
Art thou not second woman in the realm ,
And the protector's wife , belov'd of him ?
Hast thou not worldly pleasure at command ,
Above the reach or compass of thy thought ?
And wilt thou still be hammering treachery ,
To tumble down thy husband and thyself 
From top of honour to disgrace's feet ?
Away from me , and let me hear no more .

What , what , my lord , are you so choleric 
With Eleanor , for telling but her dream ?
Next time I'll keep my dreams unto myself ,
And not be check'd .

Nay , be not angry ; I am pleas'd again .


My Lord Protector , 'tis his highness' pleasure 
You do prepare to ride unto Saint Alban's ,
Whereas the king and queen do mean to hawk .

I go . Come , Nell , thou wilt ride with us ?

Yes , my good lord , I'll follow presently .

Follow I must ; I cannot go before ,
While Gloucester bears this base and humble mind .
Were I a man , a duke , and next of blood ,
I would remove these tedious stumbling-blocks 
And smooth my way upon their headless necks ;
And , being a woman , I will not be slack 
To play my part in Fortune's pageant .
Where are you there , Sir John , nay , fear not , man ,
We are alone ; here's none but thee and I .


Jesus preserve your royal majesty !

What sayst thou , majesty , I am but Grace .

But , by the grace of God , and Hume's advice ,
Your Grace's title shall be multiplied .

What sayst thou , man , hast thou as yet conferr'd 
With Margery Jourdain , the cunning witch ,
With Roger Bolingbroke , the conjurer ?
And will they undertake to do me good ?

This they have promised , to show your highness 
A spirit rais'd from depth of under ground ,
That shall make answer to such questions 
As by your Grace shall be propounded him .

It is enough : I'll think upon the questions .
When from Saint Alban's we do make return 
We'll see these things effected to the full .
Here , Hume , take this reward ; make merry , man ,
With thy confed'rates in this weighty cause .


Hume must make merry with the duchess' gold ;
Marry and shall . But how now , Sir John Hume !
Seal up your lips , and give no words but mum :
The business asketh silent secrecy .
Dame Eleanor gives gold to bring the witch :
Gold cannot come amiss , were she a devil .
Yet have I gold flies from another coast :
I dare not say from the rich cardinal 
And from the great and new-made Duke of Suffolk ;
Yet I do find it so : for , to be plain ,
They , knowing Dame Eleanor's aspiring humour ,
Have hired me to undermine the duchess 
And buzz these conjurations in her brain .
They say , 'A crafty knave does need no broker ;' 
Yet am I Suffolk and the cardinal's broker .
Hume , if you take not heed , you shall go near 
To call them both a pair of crafty knaves .
Well , so it stands ; and thus , I fear , at last 
Hume's knavery will be the duchess' wrack ,
And her attainture will be Humphrey's fall .
Sort how it will I shall have gold for all .


My masters , let's stand close : my Lord Protector will come this way by and by , and then we may deliver our supplications in the quill .

Marry , the Lord protect him , for he's a good man , Jesu bless him !


Here a' comes , methinks , and the queen with him . I'll be the first , sure .

Come back , fool , this is the Duke of Suffolk and not my Lord Protector .

How now , fellow , wouldst anything with me ?

I pray , my lord , pardon me : I took ye for my Lord Protector .

To my Lord Protector , are your supplications to his lordship , Let me see them : what is thine ?

Mine is , an't please your Grace , against John Goodman , my Lord Cardinal's man , for keeping my house , and lands , my wife and all , from me .

Thy wife too , that is some wrong indeed . What's yours , What's here , Against the Duke of Suffolk , for enclosing the commons of Melford , How now , sir knave !

Alas , sir , I am but a poor petitioner of our whole township .

Against my master , Thomas Horner , for saying that the Duke of York was rightful heir to the crown .

What sayst thou , Did the Duke of York say he was rightful heir to the crown ?

That my master was , No , forsooth : my master said that he was ; and that the king was an usurper .

Who is there ?


Take this fellow in , and send for his master with a pursuivant presently . We'll hear more of your matter before the king .

And as for you , that love to be protected 
Under the wings of our protector's grace ,
Begin your suits anew and sue to him .

Away , base cullions , Suffolk , let them go .

Come , let's be gone .


My Lord of Suffolk , say , is this the guise ,
Is this the fashion of the court of England ?
Is this the government of Britain's isle ,
And this the royalty of Albion's king ?
What , shall King Henry be a pupil still 
Under the surly Gloucester's governance ?
Am I a queen in title and in style ,
And must be made a subject to a duke ?
I tell thee , Pole , when in the city Tours 
Thou ran'st a tilt in honour of my love ,
And stol'st away the ladies' hearts of France ,
I thought King Henry had resembled thee 
In courage , courtship , and proportion :
But all his mind is bent to holiness ,
To number Ave-Maries on his beads ;
His champions are the prophets and apostles ;
His weapons holy saws of sacred writ ;
His study is his tilt-yard , and his loves 
Are brazen images of canoniz'd saints .
I would the college of the cardinals 
Would choose him pope , and carry him to Rome ,
And set the triple crown upon his head :
That were a state fit for his holiness .

Madam , be patient ; as I was cause 
Your highness came to England , so will I 
In England work your Grace's full content .

Beside the haught protector , have we Beaufort 
The imperious churchman , Somerset , Buckingham ,
And grumbling York ; and not the least of these 
But can do more in England than the king .

And he of these that can do most of all 
Cannot do more in England than the Nevils :
Salisbury and Warwick are no simple peers .

Not all these lords do vex me half so much 
As that proud dame , the Lord Protector's wife :
She sweeps it through the court with troops of ladies ,
More like an empress than Duke Humphrey's wife .
Strangers in court do take her for the queen :
She bears a duke's revenues on her back ,
And in her heart she scorns our poverty .
Shall I not live to be aveng'd on her ?
Contemptuous base-born callot as she is ,
She vaunted 'mongst her minions t'other day 
The very train of her worst wearing gown 
Was better worth than all my father's lands ,
Till Suffolk gave two dukedoms for his daughter .

Madam , myself have lim'd a bush for her ,
And plac'd a quire of such enticing birds 
That she will light to listen to the lays ,
And never mount to trouble you again .
So , let her rest : and , madam , list to me ;
For I am bold to counsel you in this .
Although we fancy not the cardinal ,
Yet must we join with him and with the lords 
Till we have brought Duke Humphrey in disgrace .
As for the Duke of York , this late complaint 
Will make but little for his benefit :
So , one by one , we'll weed them all at last ,
And you yourself shall steer the happy helm .

For my part , noble lords , I care not which ;
Or Somerset or York , all's one to me .

If York have ill demean'd himself in France ,
Then let him be denay'd the regentship .

If Somerset be unworthy of the place ,
Let York be regent ; I will yield to him .

Whether your Grace be worthy , yea or no ,
Dispute not that : York is the worthier .

Ambitious Warwick , let thy betters speak .

The cardinal's not my better in the field .

All in this presence are thy betters , Warwick .

Warwick may live to be the best of all .

Peace , son , and show some reason , Buckingham ,
Why Somerset should be preferr'd in this .

Because the king , forsooth , will have it so .

Madam , the king is old enough himself 
To give his censure : these are no women's matters .

If he be old enough , what needs your Grace 
To be protector of his excellence ?

Madam , I am protector of the realm ;
And at his pleasure will resign my place .

Resign it then and leave thine insolence .
Since thou wertking ,as who is king but thou ?
The commonwealth hath daily run to wrack ;
The Dauphin hath prevail'd beyond the seas ;
And all the peers and nobles of the realm 
Have been as bondmen to thy sovereignty .

The commons hast thou rack'd ; the clergy's bags 
Are lank and lean with thy extortions .

Thy sumptuous buildings and thy wife's attire 
Have cost a mass of public treasury .

Thy cruelty in execution 
Upon offenders hath exceeded law ,
And left thee to the mercy of the law .

Thy sale of offices and towns in France ,
If they were known , as the suspect is great ,
Would make thee quickly hop without thy head .

Give me my fan : what , minion , can ye not ?

I cry you mercy , madam , was it you ?

Was't I , yea , I it was , proud Frenchwoman :
Could I come near your beauty with my nails 
I'd set my ten commandments in your face .

Sweet aunt , be quiet ; 'twas against her will .

Against her will , Good king , look to't in time ;
She'll hamper thee and dandle thee like a baby :
Though in this place most master wear no breeches ,
She shall not strike Dame Eleanor unreveng'd .


Lord Cardinal , I will follow Eleanor ,
And listen after Humphrey , how he proceeds :
She's tickled now ; her fume can need no spurs ,
She'll gallop far enough to her destruction .

Now , lords , my choler being over-blown 
With walking once about the quadrangle ,
I come to talk of commonwealth affairs .
As for your spiteful false objections ,
Prove them , and I lie open to the law :
But God in mercy so deal with my soul 
As I in duty love my king and country !
But to the matter that we have in hand .
I say , my sov'reign , York is meetest man 
To be your regent in the realm of France .

Before we make election , give me leave 
To show some reason , of no little force ,
That York is most unmeet of any man .

I'll tell thee , Suffolk , why I am unmeet :
First , for I cannot flatter thee in pride ;
Next , if I be appointed for the place ,
My Lord of Somerset will keep me here ,
Without discharge , money , or furniture ,
Till France be won into the Dauphin's hands .
Last time I danc'd attendance on his will 
Till Paris was besieg'd , famish'd , and lost .

That can I witness ; and a fouler fact 
Did never traitor in the land commit .

Peace , headstrong Warwick !

Image of pride , why should I hold my peace ?


Because here is a man accus'd of treason :
Pray God the Duke of York excuse himself !

Doth any one accuse York for a traitor ?

What mean'st thou , Suffolk , tell me , what are these ?

Please it your majesty , this is the man 
That doth accuse his master of high treason .
His words were these : that Richard , Duke of York ,
Was rightful heir unto the English crown ,
And that your majesty was a usurper .

Say , man , were these thy words ?

An't shall please your majesty , I never said nor thought any such matter : God is my witness , I am falsely accused by the villain .

By these ten bones , my lords , he did speak them to me in the garret one night , as we were scouring my Lord of York's armour .

Base dunghill villain , and mechanical ,
I'll have thy head for this thy traitor's speech .
I do beseech your royal majesty 
Let him have all the rigour of the law .

Alas , my lord , hang me if ever I spake the words . My accuser is my prentice ; and when I did correct him for his fault the other day , he did vow upon his knees he would be even with me : I have good witness of this : therefore I beseech your majesty , do not cast away an honest man for a villain's accusation .

Uncle , what shall we say to this in law ?

This doom , my lord , if I may judge .
Let Somerset be regent o'er the French ,
Because in York this breeds suspicion ;
And let these have a day appointed them 
For single combat in convenient place ;
For he hath witness of his servant's malice .
This is the law , and this Duke Humphrey's doom .

Then be it so . My Lord of Somerset ,
We make your Grace lord regent o'er the French .

I humbly thank your royal majesty .

And I accept the combat willingly .

Alas , my lord , I cannot fight : for God's sake , pity my case , the spite of man prevaileth against me . O Lord , have mercy upon me , I shall never be able to fight a blow . O Lord , my heart !

Sirrah , or you must fight , or else be hang'd .

Away with them to prison ; and the day 
Of combat shall be the last of the next month .
Come , Somerset , we'll see thee sent away .


Come , my masters ; the duchess , I tell you , expects performance of your promises .

Master Hume , we are therefore provided . Will her ladyship behold and hear our exorcisms ?

Ay ; what else , fear you not her courage .

I have heard her reported to be a woman of invincible spirit : but it shall be convenient , Master Hume , that you be by her aloft while we be busy below ; and so , I pray you , go in God's name , and leave us .

Mother Jourdain , be you prostrate , and grovel on the earth ; John Southwell , read you ; and let us to our work .


Well said , my masters , and welcome all .
To this gear the sooner the better .

Patience , good lady ; wizards know their times :
Deep night , dark night , the silent of the night ,
The time of night when Troy was set on fire ;
The time when screech-owls cry , and ban-dogs howl ,
And spirits walk , and ghosts break up their graves ,
That time best fits the work we have in hand .
Madam , sit you , and fear not : whom we raise 
We will make fast within a hallow'd verge .


Adsum .

Asmath !
By the eternal God , whose name and power 
Thou tremblest at , answer that I shall ask ;
For till thou speak , thou shalt not pass from hence .

Ask what thou wilt . That I had said and done !

First , of the king : what shall of him become ?

The Duke yet lives that Henry shall depose ;
But him outlive , and die a violent death .


What fate awaits the Duke of Suffolk ?

By water shall he die and take his end .

What shall befall the Duke of Somerset ?

Let him shun castles :
Safer shall he be upon the sandy plains 
Than where castles mounted stand .
Have done , for more I hardly can endure .

Descend to darkness and the burning lake !
False fiend , avoid !

Lay hands upon these traitors and their trash .
Beldam , I think we watch'd you at an inch .
What , madam , are you there , the king and commonweal 
Are deeply indebted for this piece of pains :
My Lord Protector will , I doubt it not ,
See you well guerdon'd for these good deserts .

Not half so bad as thine to England's king ,
Injurious duke , that threat'st where is no cause .

True , madam , none at all . What call you this ?

Away with them , let them be clapp'd up close 
And kept asunder . You , madam , shall with us :
Stafford , take her to thee .

We'll see your trinkets here all forthcoming .
All , away !


Lord Buckingham , methinks you watch'd her well :
A pretty plot , well chosen to build upon !
Now , pray , my lord , let's see the devil's writ .
What have we here ?
The duke yet lives that Henry shall depose ;
But him outlive , and die a violent death .
Why , this is just ,
Aio te ,  acida , Romanos vincere posse .
Well , to the rest :
Tell me what fate awaits the Duke of Suffolk ?
By water shall he die and take his end .
What shall betide the Duke of Somerset ?
Let him shun castles :
Safer shall he be upon the sandy plains 
Than where castles mounted stand .
Come , come , my lords ; these oracles 
Are hardly attain'd , and hardly understood .
The king is now in progress towards Saint Alban's ;
With him , the husband of this lovely lady :
Thither go these news as fast as horse can carry them ,
A sorry breakfast for my Lord Protector .

Your Grace shall give me leave , my Lord of York ,
To be the post , in hope of his reward .

At your pleasure , my good lord . Who's within there , ho !


Invite my Lords of Salisbury and Warwick 
To sup with me to-morrow night . Away !


Believe me , lords , for flying at the brook ,
I saw not better sport these seven years' day :
Yet , by your leave , the wind was very high ,
And , ten to one , old Joan had not gone out .

But what a point , my lord , your falcon made ,
And what a pitch she flew above the rest !
To see how God in all his creatures works !
Yea , man and birds are fain of climbing high .

No marvel , an it like your majesty ,
My Lord Protector's hawks do tower so well ;
They know their master loves to be aloft ,
And bears his thoughts above his falcon's pitch .

My lord , 'tis but a base ignoble mind 
That mounts no higher than a bird can soar .

I thought as much ; he'd be above the clouds .

Ay , my Lord Cardinal ; how think you by that ?
Were it not good your Grace could fly to heaven ?

The treasury of everlasting joy .

Thy heaven is on earth ; thine eyes and thoughts 
Beat on a crown , the treasure of thy heart ;
Pernicious protector , dangerous peer ,
That smooth'st it so with king and commonweal !

What , cardinal , is your priesthood grown peremptory ?
Tant ne animis c lestibus ir ?
Churchmen so hot , good uncle , hide such malice ;
With such holiness can you do it ?

No malice , sir ; no more than well becomes 
So good a quarrel and so bad a peer .

As who , my lord ?

Why , as you , my lord ,
An't like your lordly lord-protectorship .

Why , Suffolk , England knows thine insolence .

And thy ambition , Gloucester .

I prithee , peace ,
Good queen , and whet not on these furious peers ;
For blessed are the peacemakers on earth .

Let me be blessed for the peace I make 
Against this proud protector with my sword !

Faith , holy uncle , would 'twere come to that !

Marry , when thou dar'st .

Make up no factious numbers for the matter ;
In thine own person answer thy abuse .

Ay , where thou dar'st not peep : an if thou dar'st ,
This evening on the east side of the grove .

How now , my lords !

Believe me , cousin Gloucester ,
Had not your man put up the fowl so suddenly ,
We had had more sport .

Come with thy two-hand sword .

True , uncle .

Are you advis'd ?

the east side of the grove .

Cardinal , I am with you .

Why , how now , uncle Gloucester !

Talking of hawking ; nothing else , my lord .


Now , by God's mother , priest , I'll shave your crown 
For this , or all my fence shall fail .

Medice teipsum ;
Protector , see to't well , protect yourself .

The winds grow high ; so do your stomachs , lords .
How irksome is this music to my heart !
When such strings jar , what hope of harmony ?
I pray , my lords , let me compound this strife .


What means this noise ?
Fellow , what miracle dost thou proclaim ?

A miracle , a miracle !

Come to the king , and tell him what miracle .

Forsooth , a blind man at Saint Alban's shrine ,
Within this half hour hath receiv'd his sight ;
A man that ne'er saw in his life before .

Now , God be prais'd , that to believing souls 
Gives light in darkness , comfort in despair !

Here comes the townsmen on procession ,
To present your highness with the man .

Great is his comfort in this earthly vale ,
Although by his sight his sin be multiplied .

Stand by , my masters ; bring him near the king :
His highness' pleasure is to talk with him .

Good fellow , tell us here the circumstance ,
That we for thee may glorify the Lord .
What , hast thou been long blind , and now restor'd ?

Born blind , an't please your Grace .

Ay , indeed , was he .

What woman is this ?

His wife , an't like your worship .

Hadst thou been his mother , thou couldst have better told .

Where wert thou born ?

At Berwick in the north , an't like your Grace .

Poor soul , God's goodness hath been great to thee :
Let never day nor night unhallow'd pass ,
But still remember what the Lord hath done .

Tell me , good fellow , cam'st thou here by chance ,
Or of devotion , to this holy shrine ?

God knows , of pure devotion ; being call'd 
A hundred times and oft'ner in my sleep ,
By good Saint Alban ; who said , 'Simpcox , come ;
Come , offer at my shrine , and I will help thee .' 

Most true , forsooth ; and many time and oft 
Myself have heard a voice to call him so .

What , art thou lame ?

Ay , God Almighty help me !

How cam'st thou so ?

A fall off of a tree .

A plum-tree , master .

How long hast thou been blind ?

O , born so , master .

What , and wouldst climb a tree ?

But that in all my life , when I was a youth .

Too true ; and bought his climbing very dear .

Mass , thou lov'dst plums well , that wouldst venture so .

Alas , master , my wife desir'd some damsons ,
And made me climb with danger of my life .

A subtle knave , but yet it shall not serve .
Let me see thine eyes : wink now : now open them :
In my opinion yet thou seest not well .

Yes , master , clear as day ; I thank God and Saint Alban .

Sayst thou me so , What colour is this cloak of ?

Red , master ; red as blood .

Why , that's well said . What colour is my gown of ?

Black , forsooth ; coal-black , as jet .

Why then , thou know'st what colour jet is of ?

And yet , I think , jet did he never see .

But cloaks and gowns before this day a many .

Never , before this day , in all his life .

Tell me , sirrah , what's my name ?

Alas , master , I know not .

What's his name ?

I know not .

Nor his ?

No , indeed , master .

What's thine own name ?

Saunder Simpcox , an if it please you , master .

Then , Saunder , sit there , the lyingest knave in Christendom . If thou hadst been born blind , thou mightst as well have known all our names as thus to name the several colours we do wear . Sight may distinguish of colours , but suddenly to nominate them all , it is impossible . My lords , Saint Alban here hath done a miracle ; and would ye not think that cunning to be great , that could restore this cripple to his legs again ?

O , master , that you could !

My masters of Saint Alban's , have you not beadles in your town , and things called whips ?

Yes , my lord , if it please your Grace .

Then send for one presently .

Sirrah , go fetch the beadle hither straight .


Now fetch me a stool hither by and by .


Now , sirrah , if you mean to save yourself from whipping , leap me over this stool and run away .

Alas , master , I am not able to stand alone :
You go about to torture me in vain .


Well , sir , we must have you find your legs . Sirrah beadle , whip him till he leap over that same stool .

I will , my lord . Come on , sirrah ; off with your doublet quickly .

Alas , master , what shall I do , I am not able to stand .

O God , seest thou this , and bear'st so long ?

It made me laugh to see the villain run .

Follow the knave ; and take this drab away .

Alas , sir , we did it for pure need .

Let them be whipp'd through every market town 
Till they come to Berwick , from whence they came .


Duke Humphrey has done a miracle to-day .

True ; made the lame to leap and fly away .

But you have done more miracles than I ;
You made in a day , my lord , whole towns to fly .


What tidings with our cousin Buckingham ?

Such as my heart doth tremble to unfold .
A sort of naughty persons , lewdly bent ,
Under the countenance and confederacy 
Of Lady Eleanor , the protector's wife ,
The ringleader and head of all this rout ,
Have practis'd dangerously against your state ,
Dealing with witches and with conjurers :
Whom we have apprehended in the fact ;
Raising up wicked spirits from under-ground ,
Demanding of King Henry's life and death ,
And other of your highness' privy council ,
As more at large your Grace shall understand .

And so , my Lord Protector , by this means 
Your lady is forthcoming yet at London .
This news , I think , hath turn'd your weapon's edge ;
'Tis like , my lord , you will not keep your hour .

Ambitious churchman , leave to afflict my heart :
Sorrow and grief have vanquish'd all my powers ;
And , vanquish'd as I am , I yield to thee ,
Or to the meanest groom .

O God , what mischiefs work the wicked ones ,
Heaping confusion on their own heads thereby .

Gloucester , see here the tainture of thy nest ;
And look thyself be faultless , thou wert best .

Madam , for myself , to heaven I do appeal ,
How I have lov'd my king and commonweal ;
And , for my wife , I know not how it stands .
Sorry I am to hear what I have heard :
Noble she is , but if she have forgot 
Honour and virtue , and convers'd with such 
As , like to pitch , defile nobility ,
I banish her my bed and company ,
And give her , as a prey , to law and shame ,
That hath dishonour'd Gloucester's honest name .

Well , for this night we will repose us here :
To-morrow toward London back again ,
To look into this business thoroughly ,
And call these foul offenders to their answers ;
And poise the cause in justice' equal scales ,
Whose beam stands sure , whose rightful cause prevails .


Now , my good Lords of Salisbury and Warwick ,
Our simple supper ended , give me leave ,
In this close walk to satisfy myself ,
In craving your opinion of my title ,
Which is infallible to England's crown .

My lord , I long to hear it at full .

Sweet York , begin ; and if thy claim be good ,
The Nevils are thy subjects to command .

Then thus :
Edward the Third , my lords , had seven sons :
The first , Edward the Black Prince , Prince of Wales ;
The second , William of Hatfield ; and the third ,
Lionel , Duke of Clarence ; next to whom 
Was John of Gaunt , the Duke of Lancaster ;
The fifth was Edmund Langley , Duke of York ;
The sixth was Thomas of Woodstock , Duke of Gloucester ;
William of Windsor was the seventh and last .
Edward the Black Prince died before his father ,
And left behind him Richard , his only son ,
Who after Edward the Third's death , reign'd as king ;
Till Henry Bolingbroke , Duke of Lancaster ,
The eldest son and heir of John of Gaunt ,
Crown'd by the name of Henry the Fourth ,
Seiz'd on the realm , depos'd the rightful king ,
Sent his poor queen to France , from whence she came ,
And him to Pomfret ; where as all you know ,
Harmless Richard was murder'd traitorously .

Father , the duke hath told the truth ;
Thus got the house of Lancaster the crown .

Which now they hold by force and not by right ;
For Richard , the first son's heir , being dead ,
The issue of the next son should have reign'd .

But William of Hatfield died without an heir .

The third son , Duke of Clarence , from whose line 
I claim the crown , had issue , Philippe a daughter ,
Who married Edmund Mortimer , Earl of March :
Edmund had issue Roger , Earl of March :
Roger had issue Edmund , Anne , and Eleanor .

This Edmund , in the reign of Bolingbroke ,
As I have read , laid claim unto the crown ;
And but for Owen Glendower , had been king ,
Who kept him in captivity till he died .
But , to the rest .

His eldest sister , Anne ,
My mother , being heir unto the crown ,
Married Richard , Earl of Cambridge , who was son 
To Edmund Langley , Edward the Third's fifth son .
By her I claim the kingdom : she was heir 
To Roger , Earl of March ; who was the son 
Of Edmund Mortimer ; who married Philippe ,
Sole daughter unto Lionel , Duke of Clarence :
So , if the issue of the eldest son 
Succeed before the younger , I am king .

What plain proceeding is more plain than this ?
Henry doth claim the crown from John of Gaunt ,
The fourth son ; York claims it from the third .
Till Lionel's issue fails , his should not reign :
It fails not yet , but flourishes in thee ,
And in thy sons , fair slips of such a stock .
Then , father Salisbury , kneel we together ,
And in this private plot be we the first 
That shall salute our rightful sovereign 
With honour of his birthright to the crown .

Long live our sovereign Richard , England's king !

We thank you , lords , But I am not your king 
Till I be crown'd , and that my sword be stain'd 
With heart-blood of the house of Lancaster ;
And that's not suddenly to be perform'd ,
But with advice and silent secrecy .
Do you as I do in these dangerous days ,
Wink at the Duke of Suffolk's insolence ,
At Beaufort's pride , at Somerset's ambition ,
At Buckingham and all the crew of them ,
Till they have snar'd the shepherd of the flock ,
That virtuous prince , the good Duke Humphrey :
'Tis that they seek ; and they , in seeking that 
Shall find their deaths , if York can prophesy .

My lord , break we off ; we know your mind at full .

My heart assures me that the Earl of Warwick 
Shall one day make the Duke of York a king .

And , Nevil , this I do assure myself ,
Richard shall live to make the Earl of Warwick 
The greatest man in England but the king .


Stand forth , Dame Eleanor Cobham , Gloucester's wife .
In sight of God and us , your guilt is great :
Receive the sentence of the law for sins 
Such as by God's book are adjudg'd to death .
You four , from hence to prison back again ;
From thence , unto the place of execution :
The witch in Smithfield shall be burn'd to ashes ,
And you three shall be strangled on the gallows .
You , madam , for you are more nobly born ,
Despoiled of your honour in your life ,
Shall , after three days' open penance done ,
Live in your country here , in banishment ,
With Sir John Stanley , in the Isle of Man .

Welcome is banishment ; welcome were my death .

Eleanor , the law , thou seest , hath judged thee :
I cannot justify whom the law condemns .

Mine eyes are full of tears , my heart of grief .
Ah , Humphrey , this dishonour in thine age 
Will bring thy head with sorrow to the ground .
I beseech your majesty , give me leave to go ;
Sorrow would solace and mine age would ease .

Stay , Humphrey , Duke of Gloucester : ere thou go ,
Give up thy staff : Henry will to himself 
Protector be ; and God shall be my hope ,
My stay , my guide , and lantern to my feet .
And go in peace , Humphrey ; no less belov'd 
Than when thou wert protector to thy king .

I see no reason why a king of years 
Should be to be protected like a child .
God and King Henry govern England's helm !
Give up your staff , sir , and the king his realm .

My staff , here , noble Henry , is my staff :
As willingly do I the same resign 
As e'er thy father Henry made it mine ;
And even as willingly at thy feet I leave it 
As others would ambitiously receive it .
Farewell , good king , when I am dead and gone ,
May honourable peace attend thy throne .


Why , now is Henry king , and Margaret queen ;
And Humphrey , Duke of Gloucester , scarce himself ,
That bears so shrewd a maim : two pulls at once ;
His lady banish'd , and a limb lopp'd off ;
This staff of honour raught : there let it stand ,
Where it best fits to be , in Henry's hand .

Thus droops this lofty pine and hangs his sprays ;
Thus Eleanor's pride dies in her youngest days .

Lords , let him go . Please it your majesty 
This is the day appointed for the combat ;
And ready are the appellant and defendant ,
The armourer and his man , to enter the lists ,
So please your highness to behold the fight .

Ay , good my lord ; for purposely therefore 
Left I the court , to see this quarrel tried .

O' God's name , see the lists and all things fit :
Here let them end it ; and God defend the right !

I never saw a fellow worse bested ,
Or more afraid to fight , than is the appellant ,
The servant of this armourer , my lords .


Here , neighbour Horner , I drink to you in a cup of sack : and fear not , neighbour , you shall do well enough .

And here , neighbour , here's a cup of charneco .

And here's a pot of good double beer , neighbour : drink , and fear not your man .

Let it come , i' faith , and I'll pledge you all ; and a fig for Peter !

Here , Peter , I drink to thee ; and be not afraid .

Be merry , Peter , and fear not thy master : fight for credit of the prentices .

I thank you all : drink , and pray for me , I pray you ; for , I think , I have taken my last draught in this world . Here , Robin , an if I die , I give thee my apron : and , Will , thou shalt have my hammer : and here , Tom , take all the money that I have . O Lord bless me , I pray God , for I am never able to deal with my master , he hath learnt so much fence already .

Come , leave your drinking and fall to blows . Sirrah , what's thy name ?

Peter , forsooth .

Peter , what more ?

Thump .

Thump , then see thou thump thy master well .

Masters , I am come hither , as it were , upon my man's instigation , to prove him a knave , and myself an honest man : and touching the Duke of York , I will take my death I never meant him any ill , nor the king , nor the queen ; and therefore , Peter , have at thee with a downright blow !

Dispatch : this knave's tongue begins to double .
Sound , trumpets , alarum to the combatants .


Hold , Peter , hold , I confess , I confess treason .


Take away his weapon . Fellow , thank 
God , and the good wine in thy master's way .

O God , have I overcome mine enemies in this presence , O Peter , thou hast prevailed in right !

Go , take hence that traitor from our sight ;
For by his death we do perceive his guilt :
And God in justice hath reveal'd to us 
The truth and innocence of this poor fellow ,
Which he had thought to have murder'd wrongfully .
Come , fellow , follow us for thy reward .


Thus sometimes hath the brightest day a cloud ;
And after summer evermore succeeds 
Barren winter , with his wrathful nipping cold :
So cares and joys abound , as seasons fleet .
Sirs , what's o'clock ?

Ten , my lord .

Ten is the hour that was appointed me 
To watch the coming of my punish'd duchess :
Uneath may she endure the flinty streets ,
To tread them with her tender-feeling feet .
Sweet Nell , ill can thy noble mind abrook 
The abject people , gazing on thy face 
With envious looks still laughing at thy shame ,
That erst did follow thy proud chariot wheels 
When thou didst ride in triumph through the streets .
But , soft , I think she comes ; and I'll prepare 
My tear-stain'd eyes to see her miseries .


So please your Grace , we'll take her from the sheriff .

No , stir not , for your lives ; let her pass by .

Come you , my lord , to see my open shame ?
Now thou dost penance too . Look , how they gaze .
See , how the giddy multitude do point ,
And nod their heads , and throw their eyes on thee .
Ah , Gloucester , hide thee from their hateful looks ,
And , in thy closet pent up , rue my shame ,
And ban thine enemies , both mine and thine !

Be patient , gentle Nell ; forget this grief .

Ay , Gloucester , teach me to forget myself ;
For whilst I think I am thy wedded wife ,
And thou a prince , protector of this land ,
Methinks I should not thus be led along ,
Mail'd up in shame , with papers on my back ,
And follow'd with a rabble that rejoice 
To see my tears and hear my deep-fet groans .
The ruthless flint doth cut my tender feet ,
And when I start , the envious people laugh ,
And bid me be advised how I tread .
Ah , Humphrey , can I bear this shameful yoke ?
Trow'st thou that e'er I'll look upon the world ,
Or count them happy that enjoy the sun ?
No ; dark shall be my light , and night my day ;
To think upon my pomp shall be my hell .
Sometime I'll say , I am Duke Humphrey's wife ;
And he a prince and ruler of the land :
Yet so he rul'd and such a prince he was 
As he stood by whilst I , his forlorn duchess ,
Was made a wonder and a pointing-stock 
To every idle rascal follower .
But be thou mild and blush not at my shame ;
Nor stir at nothing till the axe of death 
Hang over thee , as , sure , it shortly will ;
For Suffolk , he that can do all in all 
With her that hateth thee , and hates us all ,
And York , and impious Beaufort , that false priest ,
Have all lim'd bushes to betray thy wings ;
And , fly thou how thou canst , they'll tangle thee :
But fear not thou , until thy foot be snar'd ,
Nor never seek prevention of thy foes .

Ah , Nell , forbear : thou aimest all awry ;
I must offend before I be attainted ;
And had I twenty times so many foes ,
And each of them had twenty times their power ,
All these could not procure me any scath ,
So long as I am loyal , true , and crimeless .
Wouldst have me rescue thee from this reproach ?
Why , yet thy scandal were not wip'd away ,
But I in danger for the breach of law .
Thy greatest help is quiet , gentle Nell :
I pray thee , sort thy heart to patience ;
These few days' wonder will be quickly worn .


I summon your Grace to his majesty's parliament , holden at Bury the first of this next month .

And my consent ne'er ask'd herein before !
This is close dealing . Well , I will be there .

My Nell , I take my leave : and , master sheriff ,
Let not her penance exceed the king's commission .

An't please your Grace , here my commission stays ;
And Sir John Stanley is appointed now 
To take her with him to the Isle of Man .

Must you , Sir John , protect my lady here ?

So am I given in charge , may't please your Grace .

Entreat her not the worse in that I pray 
You use her well . The world may laugh again ;
And I may live to do you kindness if 
You do it her : and so , Sir John , farewell .

What , gone , my lord , and bid me not farewell !

Witness my tears , I cannot stay to speak .


Art thou gone too , All comfort go with thee !
For none abides with me : my joy is death ;
Death , at whose name I oft have been afear'd ,
Because I wish'd this world's eternity .
Stanley , I prithee , go , and take me hence ;
I care not whither , for I beg no favour ,
Only convey me where thou art commanded .

Why , madam , that is to the Isle of Man ;
There to be us'd according to your state .

That's bad enough , for I am but reproach :
And shall I then be us'd reproachfully ?

Like to a duchess , and Duke Humphrey's lady :
According to that state you shall be us'd .

Sheriff , farewell , and better than I fare ,
Although thou hast been conduct of my shame .

It is my office ; and , madam , pardon me .

Ay , ay , farewell ; thy office is discharg'd .
Come , Stanley , shall we go ?

Madam , your penance done , throw off this sheet ,
And go we to attire you for our journey .

My shame will not be shifted with my sheet :
No ; it will hang upon my richest robes ,
And show itself , attire me how I can .
Go , lead the way ; I long to see my prison .


I muse my Lord of Gloucester is not come :
'Tis not his wont to be the hindmost man ,
Whate'er occasion keeps him from us now .

Can you not see , or will ye not observe 
The strangeness of his alter'd countenance ?
With what a majesty he bears himself ,
How insolent of late he is become ,
How proud , how peremptory , and unlike himself ?
We know the time since he was mild and affable ,
An if we did but glance a far-off look ,
Immediately he was upon his knee ,
That all the court admir'd him for submission :
But meet him now , and , be it in the morn ,
When everyone will give the time of day ,
He knits his brow and shows an angry eye ,
And passeth by with stiff unbowed knee ,
Disdaining duty that to us belongs .
Small curs are not regarded when they grin ,
But great men tremble when the lion roars ;
And Humphrey is no little man in England .
First note that he is near you in descent ,
And should you fall , he is the next will mount .
Me seemeth then it is no policy ,
Respecting what a rancorous mind he bears ,
And his advantage following your decease ,
That he should come about your royal person 
Or be admitted to your highness' council .
By flattery hath he won the commons' hearts ,
And when he please to make commotion ,
'Tis to be fear'd they all will follow him .
Now 'tis the spring , and weeds are shallow-rooted ;
Suffer them now and they'll o'ergrow the garden ,
And choke the herbs for want of husbandry .
The reverent care I bear unto my lord 
Made me collect these dangers in the duke .
If it be fond , call it a woman's fear ;
Which fear if better reasons can supplant ,
I will subscribe and say I wrong'd the duke .
My Lord of Suffolk , Buckingham , and York ,
Reprove my allegation if you can 
Or else conclude my words effectual .

Well hath your highness seen into this duke ;
And had I first been put to speak my mind ,
I think I should have told your Grace's tale .
The duchess , by his subornation ,
Upon my life , began her devilish practices :
Or if he were not privy to those faults ,
Yet , by reputing of his high descent ,
As , next the king he was successive heir ,
And such high vaunts of his nobility ,
Did instigate the bedlam brain-sick duchess ,
By wicked means to frame our sovereign's fall .
Smooth runs the water where the brook is deep ,
And in his simple show he harbours treason .
The fox barks not when he would steal the lamb :
No , no , my sov'reign ; Gloucester is a man 
Unsounded yet , and full of deep deceit .

Did he not , contrary to form of law ,
Devise strange deaths for small offences done ?

And did he not , in his protectorship ,
Levy great sums of money through the realm 
For soldiers' pay in France , and never sent it ?
By means whereof the towns each day revolted .

Tut , these are petty faults to faults unknown ,
Which time will bring to light in smooth Duke Humphrey .

My lords , at once : the care you have of us ,
To mow down thorns that would annoy our foot ,
Is worthy praise ; but shall I speak my conscience ,
Our kinsman Gloucester is as innocent 
From meaning treason to our royal person ,
As is the sucking lamb or harmless dove .
The duke is virtuous , mild , and too well given 
To dream on evil , or to work my downfall .

Ah , what's more dangerous than this fond affiance !
Seems he a dove , his feathers are but borrow'd ,
For he's disposed as the hateful raven :
Is he a lamb , his skin is surely lent him ,
For he's inclin'd as is the ravenous wolf .
Who cannot steal a shape that means deceit ?
Take heed , my lord ; the welfare of us all 
Hangs on the cutting short that fraudful man .


All health unto my gracious sovereign !

Welcome , Lord Somerset . What news from France ?

That all your interest in those territories 
Is utterly bereft you ; all is lost .

Cold news , Lord Somerset : but God's will be done !

Cold news for me ; for I had hope of France ,
As firmly as I hope for fertile England .
Thus are my blossoms blasted in the bud ,
And caterpillars eat my leaves away ;
But I will remedy this gear ere long ,
Or sell my title for a glorious grave .


All happiness unto my lord the king !
Pardon , my liege , that I have stay'd so long .

Nay , Gloucester , know that thou art come too soon ,
Unless thou wert more loyal than thou art :
I do arrest thee of high treason here .

Well , Suffolk's duke , thou shalt not see me blush ,
Nor change my countenance for this arrest :
A heart unspotted is not easily daunted .
The purest spring is not so free from mud 
As I am clear from treason to my sovereign .
Who can accuse me , wherein am I guilty ?

'Tis thought , my lord , that you took bribes of France ,
And , being protector , stay'd the soldiers' pay ;
By means whereof his highness hath lost France .

Is it but thought so , What are they that think it ?
I never robb'd the soldiers of their pay ,
Nor ever had one penny bribe from France .
So help me God , as I have watch'd the night ,
Ay , night by night , in studying good for England ,
That doit that e'er I wrested from the king ,
Or any groat I hoarded to my use ,
Be brought against me at my trial-day !
No ; many a pound of mine own proper store ,
Because I would not tax the needy commons ,
Have I disbursed to the garrisons ,
And never ask'd for restitution .

It serves you well , my lord , to say so much .

I say no more than truth , so help me God !

In your protectorship you did devise 
Strange tortures for offenders , never heard of ,
That England was defam'd by tyranny .

Why , 'tis well known that , whiles I was protector ,
Pity was all the fault that was in me ;
For I should melt at an offender's tears ,
And lowly words were ransom for their fault .
Unless it were a bloody murderer ,
Or foul felonious thief that fleec'd poor passengers ,
I never gave them condign punishment :
Murder , indeed , that bloody sin , I tortur'd 
Above the felon or what trespass else .

My lord , these faults are easy , quickly answer'd :
But mightier crimes are laid unto your charge ,
Whereof you cannot easily purge yourself .
I do arrest you in his highness' name ;
And here commit you to my Lord Cardinal 
To keep until your further time of trial .

My Lord of Gloucester , 'tis my special hope 
That you will clear yourself from all suspect :
My conscience tells me you are innocent .

Ah , gracious lord , these days are dangerous .
Virtue is chok'd with foul ambition ,
And charity chas'd hence by rancour's hand ;
Foul subornation is predominant ,
And equity exil'd your highness' land .
I know their complot is to have my life ;
And if my death might make this island happy ,
And prove the period of their tyranny ,
I would expend it with all willingness ;
But mine is made the prologue to their play ;
For thousands more , that yet suspect no peril ,
Will not conclude their plotted tragedy .
Beaufort's red sparkling eyes blab his heart's malice ,
And Suffolk's cloudy brow his stormy hate ;
Sharp Buckingham unburdens with his tongue 
The envious load that lies upon his heart ;
And dogged York , that reaches at the moon ,
Whose overweening arm I have pluck'd back ,
By false accuse doth level at my life :
And you , my sov'reign lady , with the rest ,
Causeless have laid disgraces on my head ,
And with your best endeavour have stirr'd up 
My liefest liege to be mine enemy .
Ay , all of you have laid your heads together ;
Myself had notice of your conventicles ;
And all to make away my guiltless life .
I shall not want false witness to condemn me ,
Nor store of treasons to augment my guilt ;
The ancient proverb will be well effected :
'A staff is quickly found to beat a dog .' 

My liege , his railing is intolerable .
If those that care to keep your royal person 
From treason's secret knife and traitor's rage 
Be thus upbraided , chid , and rated at ,
And the offender granted scope of speech ,
'Twill make them cool in zeal unto your Grace .

Hath he not twit our sovereign lady here 
With ignominious words , though clerkly couch'd ,
As if she had suborned some to swear 
False allegations to o'erthrow his state ?

But I can give the loser leave to chide .

Far truer spoke than meant : I lose , indeed ;
Beshrew the winners , for they play'd me false !
And well such losers may have leave to speak .

He'll wrest the sense and hold us here all day .
Lord Cardinal , he is your prisoner .

Sirs , take away the duke , and guard him sure .

Ah , thus King Henry throws away his crutch 
Before his legs be firm to bear his body :
Thus is the shepherd beaten from thy side ,
And wolves are gnarling who shall gnaw thee first .
Ah , that my fear were false , ah , that it were ;
For , good King Henry , thy decay I fear .


My lords , what to your wisdoms seemeth best 
Do or undo , as if ourself were here .

What , will your highness leave the parliament ?

Ay , Margaret ; my heart is drown'd with grief ,
Whose flood begins to flow within mine eyes ,
My body round engirt with misery ,
For what's more miserable than discontent ?
Ah , uncle Humphrey , in thy face I see 
The map of honour , truth , and loyalty ;
And yet , good Humphrey , is the hour to come 
That e'er I prov'd thee false , or fear'd thy faith .
What low'ring star now envies thy estate ,
That these great lords , and Margaret our queen ,
Do seek subversion of thy harmless life ?
Thou never didst them wrong , nor no man wrong ;
And as the butcher takes away the calf ,
And binds the wretch , and beats it when it strays ,
Bearing it to the bloody slaughter-house ,
Even so , remorseless , have they borne him hence ;
And as the dam runs lowing up and down ,
Looking the way her harmless young one went ,
And can do nought but wail her darling's loss ;
Even so myself bewails good Gloucester's case ,
With sad unhelpful tears , and with dimm'd eyes 
Look after him , and cannot do him good ;
So mighty are his vowed enemies .
His fortunes I will weep ; and , 'twixt each groan ,
Say 'Who's a traitor , Gloucester he is none .' 


Fair lords , cold snow melts with the sun's hot beams .
Henry my lord is cold in great affairs ,
Too full of foolish pity ; and Gloucester's show 
Beguiles him as the mournful crocodile 
With sorrow snares relenting passengers ;
Or as the snake , roll'd in a flow'ring bank ,
With shining checker'd slough , doth sting a child 
That for the beauty thinks it excellent .
Believe me , lords , were none more wise than I ,
And yet herein I judge mine own wit good ,
This Gloucester should be quickly rid the world ,
To rid us from the fear we have of him .

That he should die is worthy policy ;
And yet we want a colour for his death .
'Tis meet he be condemn'd by course of law .

But in my mind that were no policy :
The king will labour still to save his life ;
The commons haply rise to save his life ;
And yet we have but trivial argument ,
More than mistrust , that shows him worthy death .

So that , by this , you would not have him die .

Ah , York , no man alive so fain as I .

'Tis York that hath more reason for his death .
But my Lord Cardinal , and you , my Lord of Suffolk ,
Say as you think , and speak it from your souls ,
Were't not all one an empty eagle were set 
To guard the chicken from a hungry kite ,
As place Duke Humphrey for the king's protector ?

So the poor chicken should be sure of death .

Madam , 'tis true : and were't not madness , then ,
To make the fox surveyor of the fold ?
Who , being accus'd a crafty murderer ,
His guilt should be but idly posted over 
Because his purpose is not executed .
No ; let him die , in that he is a fox ,
By nature prov'd an enemy to the flock ,
Before his chaps be stain'd with crimson blood ,
As Humphrey , prov'd by reasons , to my liege .
And do not stand on quillets how to slay him :
Be it by gins , by snares , by subtilty ,
Sleeping or waking , 'tis no matter how ,
So he be dead ; for that is good deceit 
Which mates him first that first intends deceit .

Thrice noble Suffolk , 'tis resolutely spoke .

Not resolute , except so much were done ,
For things are often spoke and seldom meant ;
But , that my heart accordeth with my tongue ,
Seeing the deed is meritorious ,
And to preserve my sovereign from his foe ,
Say but the word and I will be his priest .

But I would have him dead , my Lord of Suffolk ,
Ere you can take due orders for a priest :
Say you consent and censure well the deed ,
And I'll provide his executioner ;
I tender so the safety of my liege .

Here is my hand , the deed is worthy doing .

And so say I .

And I : and now we three have spoke it ,
It skills not greatly who impugns our doom .


Great lords , from Ireland am I come amain ,
To signify that rebels there are up ,
And put the Englishmen unto the sword .
Send succours , lords , and stop the rage betime ,
Before the wound do grow uncurable ;
For , being green , there is great hope of help .

A breach that craves a quick expedient stop !
What counsel give you in this weighty cause ?

That Somerset be sent as regent thither .
'Tis meet that lucky ruler be employ'd ;
Witness the fortune he hath had in France .

If York , with all his far-fet policy ,
Had been the regent there instead of me ,
He never would have stay'd in France so long .

No , not to lose it all , as thou hast done :
I rather would have lost my life betimes 
Than bring a burden of dishonour home ,
By staying there so long till all were lost .
Show me one scar character'd on thy skin :
Men's flesh preserv'd so whole do seldom win .

Nay then , this spark will prove a raging fire ,
If wind and fuel be brought to feed it with .
No more , good York ; sweet Somerset , be still :
Thy fortune , York , hadst thou been regent there ,
Might happily have prov'd far worse than his .

What , worse than nought , nay , then a shame take all .

And in the number thee , that wishest shame .

My Lord of York , try what your fortune is .
The uncivil kerns of Ireland are in arms 
And temper clay with blood of Englishmen :
To Ireland will you lead a band of men ,
Collected choicely , from each county some ,
And try your hap against the Irishmen ?

I will , my lord , so please his majesty .

Why , our authority is his consent ,
And what we do establish he confirms :
Then , noble York , take thou this task in hand .

I am content : provide me soldiers , lords ,
Whiles I take order for mine own affairs .

A charge , Lord York , that I will see perform'd .
But now return we to the false Duke Humphrey .

No more of him ; for I will deal with him 
That henceforth he shall trouble us no more .
And so break off ; the day is almost spent .
Lord Suffolk , you and I must talk of that event .

My Lord of Suffolk , within fourteen days 
At Bristol I expect my soldiers ;
For there I'll ship them all for Ireland .

I'll see it truly done , my Lord of York .


Now , York , or never , steel thy fearful thoughts ,
And change misdoubt to resolution :
Be that thou hop'st to be , or what thou art 
Resign to death ; it is not worth the enjoying .
Let pale-fac'd fear keep with the mean-born man ,
And find no harbour in a royal heart .
Faster than spring-time showers comes thought on thought ,
And not a thought but thinks on dignity .
My brain , more busy than the labouring spider ,
Weaves tedious snares to trap mine enemies .
Well , nobles , well ; 'tis politicly done ,
To send me packing with a host of men :
I fear me you but warm the starved snake ,
Who , cherish'd in your breasts , will sting your hearts .
'Twas men I lack'd , and you will give them me :
I take it kindly ; yet be well assur'd 
You put sharp weapons in a madman's hands .
Whiles I in Ireland nourish a mighty band ,
I will stir up in England some black storm 
Shall blow ten thousand souls to heaven or hell ;
And this fell tempest shall not cease to rage 
Until the golden circuit on my head ,
Like to the glorious sun's transparent beams ,
Do calm the fury of this mad-bred flaw .
And , for a minister of my intent ,
I have seduc'd a headstrong Kentishman ,
John Cade of Ashford ,
To make commotion , as full well he can ,
Under the title of John Mortimer .
In Ireland have I seen this stubborn Cade 
Oppose himself against a troop of kerns ,
And fought so long , till that his thighs with darts 
Were almost like a sharp-quill'd porpentine :
And , in the end being rescu'd , I have seen 
Him caper upright like a wild Morisco ,
Shaking the bloody darts as he his bells .
Full often , like a shag-hair'd crafty kern ,
Hath he conversed with the enemy ,
And undiscover'd come to me again ,
And given me notice of their villanies .
This devil here shall be my substitute ;
For that John Mortimer , which now is dead ,
In face , in gait , in speech , he doth resemble ;
By this I shall perceive the commons' mind ,
How they affect the house and claim of York .
Say he be taken , rack'd , and tortured ,
I know no pain they can inflict upon him 
Will make him say I mov'd him to those arms .
Say that he thrive ,as 'tis great like he will ,
Why , then from Ireland come I with my strength ,
And reap the harvest which that rascal sow'd ;
For , Humphrey being dead , as he shall be ,
And Henry put apart , the next for me .


Run to my Lord of Suffolk ; let him know 
We have dispatch'd the duke , as he commanded .

O , that it were to do . What have we done ?
Didst ever hear a man so penitent ?


Here comes my lord .

Now , sirs , have you dispatch'd this thing ?

Ay , my good lord , he's dead .

Why , that's well said . Go , get you to my house ;
I will reward you for this venturous deed .
The king and all the peers are here at hand .
Have you laid fair the bed , is all things well ,
According as I gave directions ?

'Tis , my good lord .

Away , be gone .

Go , call our uncle to our presence straight ;
Say , we intend to try his Grace to-day ,
If he be guilty , as 'tis published .

I'll call him presently , my noble lord .


Lords , take your places ; and , I pray you all ,
Proceed no straiter 'gainst our uncle Gloucester 
Than from true evidence , of good esteem ,
He be approv'd in practice culpable .

God forbid any malice should prevail 
That faultless may condemn a nobleman !
Pray God , he may acquit him of suspicion !

I thank thee , Meg ; these words content me much .


How now , why look'st thou pale , why tremblest thou ?

Where is our uncle , what's the matter , Suffolk ?

Dead in his bed , my lord ; Gloucester is dead .

Marry , God forfend !

God's secret judgment : I did dream to-night 
The duke was dumb , and could not speak a word .


How fares my lord , Help , lords , the king is dead .

Rear up his body ; wring him by the nose .

Run , go , help , help , O Henry , ope thine eyes !

He doth revive again . Madam , be patient .

O heavenly God !

How fares my gracious lord ?

Comfort , my sovereign , grocious Henry , comfort !

What , doth my Lord of Suffolk comfort me ?
Came he right now to sing a raven's note ,
Whose dismal tune bereft my vital powers ,
And thinks he that the chirping of a wren ,
By crying comfort from a hollow breast ,
Can chase away the first-conceived sound ?
Hide not thy poison with such sugar'd words :
Lay not thy hands on me ; forbear , I say :
Their touch affrights me as a serpent's sting .
Thou baleful messenger , out of my sight !
Upon thy eyeballs murderous tyranny 
Sits in grim majesty to fright the world .
Look not upon me , for thine eyes are wounding :
Yet do not go away ; come , basilisk ,
And kill the innocent gazer with thy sight ;
For in the shade of death I shall find joy ,
In life but double death , now Gloucester's dead .

Why do you rate my Lord of Suffolk thus ?
Although the duke was enemy to him ,
Yet he , most Christian-like , laments his death :
And for myself , foe as he was to me ,
Might liquid tears or heart-offending groans 
Or blood-consuming sighs recall his life ,
I would be blind with weeping , sick with groans ,
Look pale as primrose with blood-drinking sighs ,
And all to have the noble duke alive .
What know I how the world may deem of me ?
For it is known we were but hollow friends :
It may be judg'd I made the duke away :
So shall my name with slander's tongue be wounded ,
And princes' courts be fill'd with my reproach .
This get I by his death . Ay me , unhappy !
To be a queen , and crown'd with infamy !

Ah , woe is me for Gloucester , wretched man .

Be woe for me , more wretched than he is .
What , dost thou turn away and hide thy face ?
I am no loathsome leper ; look on me .
What , art thou , like the adder , waxen deaf ?
Be poisonous too and kill thy forlorn queen .
Is all thy comfort shut in Gloucester's tomb ?
Why , then , Dame Margaret was ne'er thy joy :
Erect his statua and worship it ,
And make my image but an alehouse sign .
Was I for this nigh wrack'd upon the sea ,
And twice by awkward wind from England's bank 
Drove back again unto my native clime ?
What boded this , but well forewarning wind 
Did seem to say , 'Seek not a scorpion's nest ,
Nor set no footing on this unkind shore ?' 
What did I then , but curs'd the gentle gusts 
And he that loos'd them forth their brazen caves ;
And bid them blow towards England's blessed shore ,
Or turn our stern upon a dreadful rock ?
Yet  olus would not be a murderer ,
But left that hateful office unto thee :
The pretty vaulting sea refus'd to drown me ,
Knowing that thou wouldst have me drown'd on shore 
With tears as salt as sea through thy unkindness :
The splitting rocks cower'd in the sinking sands ,
And would not dash me with their ragged sides ,
Because thy flinty heart , more hard than they ,
Might in thy palace perish Margaret .
As far as I could ken thy chalky cliffs ,
When from thy shore the tempest beat us back ,
I stood upon the hatches in the storm ,
And when the dusky sky began to rob 
My earnest-gaping sight of thy land's view ,
I took a costly jewel from my neck ,
A heart it was , bound in with diamonds ,
And threw it towards thy land : the sea receiv'd it ,
And so I wish'd thy body might my heart :
And even with this I lost fair England's view ,
And bid mine eyes be packing with my heart ,
And call'd them blind and dusky spectacles 
For losing ken of Albion's wished coast .
How often have I tempted Suffolk's tongue 
The agent of thy foul inconstancy 
To sit and witch me , as Ascanius did 
When he to madding Dido would unfold 
His father's acts , commenc'd in burning Troy !
Am I not witch'd like her , or thou not false like him ?
Ay me , I can no more . Die , Margaret !
For Henry weeps that thou dost live so long .

It is reported , mighty sovereign ,
That good Duke Humphrey trait'rously is murder'd 
By Suffolk and the Cardinal Beaufort's means .
The commons , like an angry hive of bees 
That want their leader , scatter up and down ,
And care not who they sting in his revenge .
Myself have calm'd their spleenful mutiny ,
Until they hear the order of his death .

That he is dead , good Warwick , 'tis too true ;
But how he died God knows , not Henry .
Enter his chamber , view his breathless corpse ,
And comment then upon his sudden death .

That shall I do , my liege . Stay , Salisbury ,
With the rude multitude till I return .


O , Thou that judgest all things , stay my thoughts ,
My thoughts that labour to persuade my soul 
Some violent hands were laid on Humphrey's life .
If my suspect be false , forgive me , God ,
For judgment only doth belong to thee .
Fain would I go to chafe his paly lips 
With twenty thousand kisses , and to drain 
Upon his face an ocean of salt tears ,
To tell my love unto his deaf dumb trunk ,
And with my fingers feel his hand unfeeling :
But all in vain are these mean obsequies ,
And to survey his dead and earthly image 
What were it but to make my sorrow greater ?


Come hither , gracious sovereign , view this body .

That is to see how deep my grave is made ;
For with his soul fled all my worldly solace ,
For seeing him I see my life in death .

As surely as my soul intends to live 
With that dread King that took our state upon him 
To free us from his Father's wrathful curse ,
I do believe that violent hands were laid 
Upon the life of this thrice-famed duke .

A dreadful oath , sworn with a solemn tongue !
What instance gives Lord Warwick for his vow ?

See how the blood is settled in his face .
Oft have I seen a timely-parted ghost ,
Of ashy semblance , meagre , pale , and bloodless ,
Being all descended to the labouring heart ;
Who , in the conflict that it holds with death ,
Attracts the same for aidance 'gainst the enemy ;
Which with the heart there cools , and ne'er returneth 
To blush and beautify the cheek again .
But see , his face is black and full of blood ,
His eyeballs further out than when he liv'd ,
Staring full ghastly like a strangled man ;
His hair uprear'd , his nostrils stretch'd with struggling :
His hands abroad display'd , as one that grasp'd 
And tugg'd for life , and was by strength subdu'd .
Look on the sheets , his hair , you see , is sticking ;
His well-proportion'd beard made rough and rugged ,
Like to the summer's corn by tempest lodg'd .
It cannot be but he was murder'd here ;
The least of all these signs were probable .

Why , Warwick , who should do the duke to death ?
Myself and Beaufort had him in protection ;
And we , I hope , sir , are no murderers .

But both of you were vow'd Duke Humphrey's foes ,
And you , forsooth , had the good duke to keep :
'Tis like you would not feast him like a friend ,
And 'tis well seen he found an enemy .

Then you , belike , suspect these noblemen 
As guilty of Duke Humphrey's timeless death .

Who finds the heifer dead , and bleeding fresh ,
And sees fast by a butcher with an axe ,
But will suspect 'twas he that made the slaughter ?
Who finds the partridge in the puttock's nest ,
But may imagine how the bird was dead ,
Although the kite soar with unbloodied beak ?
Even so suspicious is this tragedy .

Are you the butcher , Suffolk , where's your knife ?
Is Beaufort term'd a kite , where are his talons ?

I wear no knife to slaughter sleeping men ;
But here's a vengeful sword , rusted with ease ,
That shall be scoured in his rancorous heart 
That slanders me with murder's crimson badge .
Say , if thou dar'st , proud Lord of Warwickshire ,
That I am faulty in Duke Humphrey's death .


What dares not Warwick , if false Suffolk dare him ?

He dares not calm his contumelious spirit ,
Nor cease to be an arrogant controller ,
Though Suffolk dare him twenty thousand times .

Madam , be still , with reverence may I say ;
For every word you speak in his behalf 
Is slander to your royal dignity .

Blunt-witted lord , ignoble in demeanour !
If ever lady wrong'd her lord so much ,
Thy mother took into her blameful bed 
Some stern untutor'd churl , and noble stock 
Was graft with crab-tree slip ; whose fruit thou art ,
And never of the Nevils' noble race .

But that the guilt of murder bucklers thee ,
And I should rob the deathsman of his fee ,
Quitting thee thereby of ten thousand shames ,
And that my sov'reign's presence makes me mild ,
I would , false murd'rous coward , on thy knee 
Make thee beg pardon for thy passed speech ,
And say it was thy mother that thou meant'st ;
That thou thyself wast born in bastardy :
And after all this fearful homage done ,
Give thee thy hire , and send thy soul to hell ,
Pernicious blood-sucker of sleeping men .

Thou shalt be waking while I shed thy blood ,
If from this presence thou dar'st go with me .

Away even now , or I will drag thee hence :
Unworthy though thou art , I'll cope with thee ,
And do some service to Duke Humphrey's ghost .


What stronger breastplate than a heart untainted !
Thrice is he arm'd that hath his quarrel just ,
And he but naked , though lock'd up in steel ,
Whose conscience with injustice is corrupted .

What noise is this ?

Why , how now , lords , your wrathful weapons drawn 
Here in our presence , dare you be so bold ?
Why , what tumultuous clamour have we here ?

The traitorous Warwick , with the men of Bury ,
Set all upon me , mighty sovereign .


Sirs , stand apart ; the king shall know your mind .
Dread lord , the commons send you word by me ,
Unless false Suffolk straight be done to death ,
Or banished fair England's territories ,
They will by violence tear him from your palace 
And torture him with grievous lingering death .
They say , by him the good Duke Humphrey died ;
They say , in him they fear your highness' death ;
And mere instinct of love and loyalty ,
Free from a stubborn opposite intent ,
As being thought to contradict your liking ,
Makes them thus forward in his banishment .
They say , in care of your most royal person ,
That if your highness should intend to sleep ,
And charge that no man should disturb your rest 
In pain of your dislike or pain of death ,
Yet , notwithstanding such a strait edict ,
Were there a serpent seen , with forked tongue ,
That slily glided towards your majesty ,
It were but necessary you were wak'd ,
Lest , being suffer'd in that harmful slumber ,
The mortal worm might make the sleep eternal :
And therefore do they cry , though you forbid ,
That they will guard you , whe'r you will or no ,
From such fell serpents as false Suffolk is ;
With whose envenomed and fatal sting ,
Your loving uncle , twenty times his worth ,
They say , is shamefully bereft of life .

An answer from the king , my Lord of Salisbury !

'Tis like the commons , rude unpolish'd hinds ,
Could send such message to their sovereign ;
But you , my lord , were glad to be employ'd ,
To show how quaint an orator you are :
But all the honour Salisbury hath won 
Is that he was the lord ambassador ,
Sent from a sort of tinkers to the king .

An answer from the king , or we will all break in !

Go , Salisbury , and tell them all from me ,
I thank them for their tender loving care ;
And had I not been cited so by them ,
Yet did I purpose as they do entreat ;
For , sure , my thoughts do hourly prophesy 
Mischance unto my state by Suffolk's means :
And therefore , by his majesty I swear ,
Whose far unworthy deputy I am ,
He shall not breathe infection in this air 
But three days longer , on the pain of death .


O Henry , let me plead for gentle Suffolk .

Ungentle queen , to call him gentle Suffolk !
No more , I say ; if thou dost plead for him 
Thou wilt but add increase unto my wrath .
Had I but said , I would have kept my word ,
But when I swear , it is irrevocable .


If after three days' space thou here be'st found 
On any ground that I am ruler of ,
The world shall not be ransom for thy life .
Come , Warwick , come , good Warwick , go with me ;
I have great matters to impart to thee .


Mischance and sorrow go along with you !
Heart's discontent and sour affliction 
Be playfellows to keep you company !
There's two of you ; the devil make a third ,
And threefold vengeance tend upon your steps !

Cease , gentle queen , these execrations ,
And let thy Suffolk take his heavy leave .

Fie , coward woman and soft-hearted wretch !
Hast thou not spirit to curse thine enemy ?

A plague upon them , Wherefore should I curse them ?
Would curses kill , as doth the mandrake's groan ,
I would invent as bitter-searching terms ,
As curst , as harsh and horrible to hear ,
Deliver'd strongly through my fixed teeth ,
With full as many signs of deadly hate ,
As lean-fac'd Envy in her loathsome cave .
My tongue should stumble in mine earnest words ;
Mine eyes should sparkle like the beaten flint ;
My hair be fix'd on end , as one distract ;
Ay , every joint should seem to curse and ban :
And even now my burden'd heart would break 
Should I not curse them . Poison be their drink !
Gall , worse than gall , the daintiest that they taste !
Their sweetest shade a grove of cypress trees !
Their chiefest prospect murdering basilisks !
Their softest touch as smart as lizard's stings !
Their music frightful as the serpent's hiss ,
And boding screech-owls make the concert full !
All the foul terrors in dark-seated hell 

Enough , sweet Suffolk ; thou torment'st thyself ;
And these dread curses , like the sun 'gainst glass ,
Or like an over-charged gun , recoil ,
And turn the force of them upon thyself .

You bade me ban , and will you bid me leave ?
Now , by the ground that I am banish'd from ,
Well could I curse away a winter's night ,
Though standing naked on a mountain top ,
Where biting cold would never let grass grow ,
And think it but a minute spent in sport .

O , let me entreat thee , cease , Give me thy hand ,
That I may dew it with my mournful tears ;
Nor let the rain of heaven wet this place ,
To wash away my woeful monuments .
O , could this kiss be printed in thy hand ,

That thou mightst think upon these by the seal ,
Through whom a thousand sighs are breath'd for thee .
So , get thee gone , that I may know my grief ;
'Tis but surmis'd whiles thou art standing by ,
As one that surfeits thinking on a want .
I will repeal thee , or , be well assur'd ,
Adventure to be banished myself ;
And banished I am , if but from thee .
Go ; speak not to me ; even now be gone .
O , go not yet . Even thus two friends condemn'd 
Embrace and kiss , and take ten thousand leaves ,
Loather a hundred times to part than die .
Yet now farewell ; and farewell life with thee !

Thus is poor Suffolk ten times banished ,
Once by the king , and three times thrice by thee .
'Tis not the land I care for , wert thou thence ;
A wilderness is populous enough ,
So Suffolk had thy heavenly company :
For where thou art , there is the world itself ,
With every several pleasure in the world ,
And where thou art not , desolation .
I can no more : live thou to joy thy life ;
Myself to joy in nought but that thou liv'st .


Whither goes Vaux so fast , what news , I prithee ?

To signify unto his majesty 
That Cardinal Beaufort is at point of death ;
For suddenly a grievous sickness took him ,
That makes him gasp and stare , and catch the air ,
Blaspheming God , and cursing men on earth .
Sometime he talks as if Duke Humphrey's ghost 
Were by his side ; sometime he calls the king ,
And whispers to his pillow , as to him ,
The secrets of his overcharged soul :
And I am sent to tell his majesty 
That even now he cries aloud for him .

Go tell this heavy message to the king .

Ay me , what is this world , what news are these !
But wherefore grieve I at an hour's poor loss ,
Omitting Suffolk's exile , my soul's treasure ?
Why only , Suffolk , mourn I not for thee ,
And with the southern clouds contend in tears ,
Theirs for the earth's increase , mine for my sorrows ?
Now get thee hence : the king , thou know'st , is coming ;
If thou be found by me thou art but dead .

If I depart from thee I cannot live ;
And in thy sight to die , what were it else 
But like a pleasant slumber in thy lap ?
Here could I breathe my soul into the air ,
As mild and gentle as the cradle babe ,
Dying with mother's dug between its lips ;
Where , from thy sight , I should be raging mad ,
And cry out for thee to close up mine eyes ,
To have thee with thy lips to stop my mouth :
So shouldst thou either turn my flying soul ,
Or I should breathe it so into thy body ,
And then it liv'd in sweet Elysium .
To die by thee , were but to die in jest ;
From thee to die were torture more than death .
O , let me stay , befall what may befall !

Away , though parting be a fretful corsive ,
It is applied to a deathful wound .
To France , sweet Suffolk : let me hear from thee ;
For wheresoe'er thou art in this world's globe ,
I'll have an Iris that shall find thee out .

I go .

And take my heart with thee .

A jewel , lock'd into the woefull'st cask 
That ever did contain a thing of worth .
Even as a splitted bark , so sunder we :
This way fall I to death .

This way for me .


How fares my lord , speak , Beaufort , to thy sovereign .

If thou be'st death , I'll give thee England's treasure ,
Enough to purchase such another island ,
So thou wilt let me live , and feel no pain .

Ah , what a sign it is of evil life 
Where death's approach is seen so terrible .

Beaufort , it is thy sov'reign speaks to thee .

Bring me unto my trial when you will .
Died he not in his bed , where should he die ?
Can I make men live whe'r they will or no ?
O , torture me no more , I will confess .
Alive again , then show me where he is :
I'll give a thousand pound to look upon him .
He hath no eyes , the dust hath blinded them .
Comb down his hair ; look , look , it stands upright ,
Like lime-twigs set to catch my winged soul .
Give me some drink ; and bid the apothecary 
Bring the strong poison that I bought of him .

O thou eternal Mover of the heavens !
Look with a gentle eye upon this wretch ;
O , beat away the busy meddling fiend 
That lays strong siege unto this wretch's soul ,
And from his bosom purge this black despair .

See how the pangs of death do make him grin !

Disturb him not , let him pass peaceably .

Peace to his soul , if God's good pleasure be !
Lord Cardinal , if thou think'st on heaven's bliss ,
Hold up thy hand , make signal of thy hope .
He dies , and makes no sign . O God , forgive him !

So bad a death argues a monstrous life .

Forbear to judge , for we are sinners all .
Close up his eyes , and draw the curtain close ;
And let us all to meditation .

The gaudy , blabbing , and remorseful day 
Is crept into the bosom of the sea ,
And now loud-howling wolves arouse the jades 
That drag the tragic melancholy night ;
Who with their drowsy , slow , and flagging wings 
Clip dead men's graves , and from their misty jaws 
Breathe foul contagious darkness in the air .
Therefore bring forth the soldiers of our prize ,
For , whilst our pinnace anchors in the Downs 
Here shall they make their ransom on the sand ,
Or with their blood stain this discolour'd shore .
Master , this prisoner freely give I thee :
And thou that art his mate make boot of this ;
The other 

, Walter Whitmore , is thy share .

What is my ransom , master , let me know .

A thousand crowns , or else lay down your head .

And so much shall you give , or off goes yours .

What , think you much to pay two thousand crowns ,
And bear the name and port of gentlemen ?
Cut both the villains' throats , for die you shall :
The lives of those which we have lost in fight 
Cannot be counterpois'd with such a petty sum !

I'll give it , sir ; and therefore spare my life .

And so will I , and write home for it straight .

I lost mine eye in laying the prize aboard ,


And therefore to revenge it shalt thou die ;
And so should these if I might have my will .

Be not so rash : take ransom ; let him live .

Look on my George ; I am a gentleman :
Rate me at what thou wilt , thou shalt be paid .

And so am I ; my name is Walter Whitmore .
How now , why start'st thou , what , doth death affright ?

Thy name affrights me , in whose sound is death .
A cunning man did calculate my birth ,
And told me that by Water I should die :
Yet let not this make thee be bloody-minded ;
Thy name is Gaultier , being rightly sounded .

Gaultier , or Walter , which it is I care not ;
Never yet did base dishonour blur our name 
But with our sword we wip'd away the blot :
Therefore , when merchant-like I sell revenge ,
Broke be my sword , my arms torn and defac'd ,
And I proclaim'd a coward through the world !


Stay , Whitmore ; for thy prisoner is a prince ,
The Duke of Suffolk , William de la Pole .

The Duke of Suffolk muffled up in rags !

Ay , but these rags are no part of the duke :
Jove sometimes went disguis'd , and why not I ?

But Jove was never slain , as thou shalt be .

Obscure and lowly swain , King Henry's blood ,
The honourable blood of Lancaster ,
Must not be shed by such a jaded groom .
Hast thou not kiss'd thy hand and held my stirrup ?
Bare-headed plodded by my foot-cloth mule ,
And thought thee happy when I shook my head ?
How often hast thou waited at my cup ,
Fed from my trencher , kneel'd down at the board ,
When I have feasted with Queen Margaret ?
Remember it and let it make thee crest-fall'n ;
Ay , and allay this thy abortive pride .
How in our voiding lobby hast thou stood 
And duly waited for my coming forth ?
This hand of mine hath writ in thy behalf ,
And therefore shall it charm thy riotous tongue .

Speak , captain , shall I stab the forlorn swain ?

First let my words stab him , as he hath me .

Base slave , thy words are blunt , and so art thou .

Convey him hence , and on our longboat's side 
Strike off his head .

Thou dar'st not for thy own .

Yes , Pole .

Pole !

Pool , Sir Pool , lord !
Ay , kennel , puddle , sink ; whose filth and dirt 
Troubles the silver spring where England drinks .
Now will I dam up this thy yawning mouth 
For swallowing the treasure of the realm :
Thy lips , that kiss'd the queen , shall sweep the ground ;
And thou , that smil'dst at good Duke Humphrey's death ,
Against the senseless winds shall grin in vain ,
Who in contempt shall hiss at thee again :
And wedded be thou to the hags of hell ,
For daring to affy a mighty lord 
Unto the daughter of a worthless king ,
Having neither subject , wealth , nor diadem .
By devilish policy art thou grown great ,
And , like ambitious Sylla , overgorg'd 
With gobbets of thy mother's bleeding heart .
By thee Anjou and Maine were sold to France ,
The false revolting Normans thorough thee 
Disdain to call us lord , and Picardy 
Hath slain their governors , surpris'd our forts ,
And sent the ragged soldiers wounded home .
The princely Warwick , and the Nevils all ,
Whose dreadful swords were never drawn in vain ,
As hating thee , are rising up in arms :
And now the house of York , thrust from the crown 
By shameful murder of a guiltless king ,
And lofty proud encroaching tyranny ,
Burns with revenging fire ; whose hopeful colours 
Advance our half-fac'd sun , striving to shine ,
Under the which is writ Invitis nubibus .
The commons here in Kent are up in arms ;
And to conclude , reproach and beggary 
Is crept into the palace of our king ,
And all by thee . Away , convey him hence .

O , that I were a god , to shoot forth thunder 
Upon these paltry , servile , abject drudges .
Small things make base men proud : this villain here ,
Being captain of a pinnace , threatens more 
Than Bargulus the strong Illyrian pirate .
Drones suck not eagles' blood , but rob beehives .
It is impossible that I should die 
By such a lowly vassal as thyself .
Thy words move rage , and not remorse in me :
I go of message from the queen to France ;
I charge thee , waft me safely cross the Channel .

Walter !

Come , Suffolk , I must waft thee to thy death .

Gelidus timor occupat artus : 'tis thee I fear .

Thou shalt have cause to fear before I leave thee .
What , are ye daunted now , now will ye stoop ?

My gracious lord , entreat him , speak him fair .

Suffolk's imperial tongue is stern and rough ,
Us'd to command , untaught to plead for favour .
Far be it we should honour such as these 
With humble suit : no , rather let my head 
Stoop to the block than these knees bow to any 
Save to the God of heaven , and to my king ;
And sooner dance upon a bloody pole 
Than stand uncover'd to the vulgar groom .
True nobility is exempt from fear :
More can I bear than you dare execute .

Hale him away , and let him talk no more .

Come , soldiers , show what cruelty ye can ,
That this my death may never be forgot .
Great men oft die by vile bezonians .
A Roman sworder and banditto slave 
Murder'd sweet Tully ; Brutus' bastard hand 
Stabb'd Julius C sar ; savage islanders 
Pompey the Great ; and Suffolk dies by pirates .


And as for these whose ransom we have set ,
It is our pleasure one of them depart :
Therefore come you with us and let him go .

There let his head and lifeless body lie ,
Until the queen his mistress bury it .


O barbarous and bloody spectacle !
His body will I bear unto the king :
If he revenge it not , yet will his friends ;
So will the queen , that living held him dear .


Come , and get thee a sword , though made of a lath : they have been up these two days .

They have the more need to sleep now then .

I tell thee , Jack Cade the clothier means to dress the commonwealth , and turn it , and set a new nap upon it .

So he had need , for 'tis threadbare . Well , I say it was never merry world in England since gentlemen came up .

O miserable age , Virtue is not regarded in handicrafts-men .

The nobility think scorn to go in leather aprons .

Nay , more ; the king's council are no good workmen .

True ; and yet it is said , 'Labour in thy vocation :' which is as much to say as , let the magistrates be labouring men ; and therefore should we be magistrates .

Thou hast hit it ; for there's no better sign of a brave mind than a hard hand .

I see them , I see them , There's Best's son , the tanner of Wingham ,

He shall have the skins of our enemies to make dog's-leather of .

And Dick the butcher ,

Then is sin struck down like an ox , and iniquity's throat cut like a calf .

And Smith the weaver ,

Argo , their thread of life is spun .

Come , come , let's fall in with them .


We John Cade , so termed of our supposed father ,

Or rather , of stealing a cade of herrings .

For our enemies shall fall before us , inspired with the spirit of putting down kings and princes ,Command silence .

Silence !

My father was a Mortimer .

He was an honest man , and a good bricklayer .

My mother a Plantagenet ,

I knew her well ; she was a midwife .

My wife descended of the Lacies ,

She was , indeed , a pedlar's daughter , and sold many laces .

But now of late , not able to travel with her furred pack , she washes bucks here at home .

Therefore am I of an honourable house .

Ay , by my faith , the field is honourable ; and there was he born , under a hedge ; for his father had never a house but the cage .

Valiant I am .

A' must needs , for beggary is valiant .

I am able to endure much .

No question of that , for I have seen him whipped three market-days together .

I fear neither sword nor fire .

He need not fear the sword , for his coat is of proof .

But methinks he should stand in fear of fire , being burnt i' the hand for stealing of sheep .

Be brave , then ; for your captain is brave , and vows reformation . There shall be in England seven halfpenny loaves sold for a penny ; the three-hooped pot shall have ten hoops ; and I will make it felony to drink small beer . All the realm shall be in common , and in Cheapside shall my palfrey go to grass . And when I am king ,as king I will be ,

God save your majesty !

I thank you , good people : there shall be no money ; all shall eat and drink on my score , and I will apparel them all in one livery , that they may agree like brothers , and worship me their lord .

The first thing we do , let's kill all the lawyers .

Nay , that I mean to do . Is not this a lamentable thing , that of the skin of an innocent lamb should be made parchment , that parchment , being scribbled o'er , should undo a man , Some say the bee stings ; but I say , 'tis the bee's wax , for I did but seal once to a thing , and I was never mine own man since . How now , who's there ?


The clerk of Chatham : he can write and read and cast accompt .

O monstrous !

We took him setting of boys' copies .

Here's a villain !

Has a book in his pocket with red letters in't .

Nay , then he is a conjurer .

Nay , he can make obligations , and write court-hand .

I am sorry for't : the man is a proper man , of mine honour ; unless I find him guilty , he shall not die . Come hither , sirrah , I must examine thee . What is thy name ?

Emmanuel .

They use to write it on the top of letters . 'Twill go hard with you .

Let me alone . Dost thou use to write thy name , or hast thou a mark to thyself , like an honest plain-dealing man ?

Sir , I thank God , I have been so well brought up , that I can write my name .

He hath confessed : away with him , he's a villain and a traitor .

Away with him , I say : hang him with his pen and ink-horn about his neck .

Where's our general ?

Here I am , thou particular fellow .

Fly , fly , fly , Sir Humphrey Stafford and his brother are hard by , with the king's forces .

Stand , villain , stand , or I'll fell thee down . He shall be encountered with a man as good as himself : he is but a knight , is a' ?

No .

To equal him , I will make myself a knight presently .

Rise up Sir John Mortimer . [Rises .] Now have at him .


Rebellious hinds , the filth and scum of Kent ,
Mark'd for the gallows , lay your weapons down ;
Home to your cottages , forsake this groom :
The king is merciful , if you revolt .

But angry , wrathful , and inclin'd to blood ,
If you go forward : therefore yield , or die .

As for these silken-coated slaves , I pass not :
It is to you , good people , that I speak ,
O'er whom , in time to come I hope to reign ;
For I am rightful heir unto the crown .

Villain , thy father was a plasterer ;
And thou thyself a shearman , art thou not ?

And Adam was a gardener .

And what of that ?

Marry , this : Edmund Mortimer , Earl of March ,
Married the Duke of Clarence' daughter , did he not ?

Ay , sir .

By her he had two children at one birth .

That's false .

Ay , there's the question ; but I say , 'tis true :
The elder of them , being put to nurse ,
Was by a beggar-woman stol'n away ;
And , ignorant of his birth and parentage ,
Became a bricklayer when he came to age :
His son am I ; deny it if you can .

Nay , 'tis too true ; therefore he shall be king .

Sir , he made a chimney in my father's house , and the bricks are alive at this day to testify it ; therefore deny it not .

And will you credit this base drudge's words ,
That speaks he knows not what ?

Ay , marry , will we ; therefore get ye gone .

Jack Cade , the Duke of York hath taught you this .

He lies , for I invented it myself . Go to , sirrah ; tell the king from me , that , for his father's sake , Henry the Fifth , in whose time boys went to span-counter for French crowns , I am content he shall reign ; but I'll be protector over him .

And furthermore , we'll have the Lord Say's head for selling the dukedom of Maine .

And good reason ; for thereby is England mained , and fain to go with a staff , but that my puissance holds it up . Fellow kings , I tell you that that Lord Say hath gelded the commonwealth , and made it a eunuch ; and more than that , he can speak French ; and therefore he is a traitor .

O gross and miserable ignorance !

Nay , answer , if you can : the Frenchmen are our enemies ; go to then , I ask but this , can he that speaks with the tongue of an enemy be a good counsellor , or no ?

No , no ; and therefore we'll have his head .

Well , seeing gentle words will not prevail ,
Assail them with the army of the king .

Herald , away ; and throughout every town 
Proclaim them traitors that are up with Cade ;
That those which fly before the battle ends 
May , even in their wives' and children's sight ,
Be hang'd up for example at their doors :
And you , that be the king's friends , follow me .


And you , that love the commons , follow me .
Now show yourselves men ; 'tis for liberty .
We will not leave one lord , one gentleman :
Spare none but such as go in clouted shoon ,
For they are thrifty honest men , and such 
As would , but that they dare not take our parts .

They are all in order , and march toward us .

But then are we in order when we are most out of order . Come , march , forward !


Where's Dick , the butcher of Ashford ?

Here , sir .

They fell before thee like sheep and oxen , and thou behavedst thyself as if thou hadst been in thine own slaughter-house : therefore thus will I reward thee , the Lent shall be as long again as it is ; and thou shalt have a licence to kill for a hundred lacking one .

I desire no more .

And , to speak truth , thou deservest no less . This monument of the victory will I bear ;

and the bodies shall be dragged at my horse' heels , till I do come to London , where we will have the Mayor's sword borne before us .

If we mean to thrive and do good , break open the gaols and let out the prisoners .

Fear not that , I warrant thee . Come ; let's march towards London .


Oft have I heard that grief softens the mind ,
And makes it fearful and degenerate ;
Think therefore on revenge , and cease to weep .
But who can cease to weep and look on this ?
Here may his head lie on my throbbing breast ;
But where's the body that I should embrace ?

What answer makes your Grace to the rebels' supplication ?

I'll send some holy bishop to entreat ;
For God forbid so many simple souls 
Should perish by the sword , And I myself ,
Rather than bloody war shall cut them short ,
Will parley with Jack Cade their general .
But stay , I'll read it over once again .

Ah , barbarous villains , hath this lovely face 
Rul'd like a wandering planet over me ,
And could it not enforce them to relent ,
That were unworthy to behold the same ?

Lord Say , Jack Cade hath sworn to have thy head .

Ay , but I hope your highness shall have his .

How now , madam !
Still lamenting and mourning for Suffolk's death ?
I fear me , love , if that I had been dead ,
Thou wouldest not have mourn'd so much for me .

No , my love ; I should not mourn , but die for thee .


How now , what news , why com'st thou in such haste ?

The rebels are in Southwark ; fly , my lord !
Jack Cade proclaims himself Lord Mortimer ,
Descended from the Duke of Clarence' house ,
And calls your Grace usurper openly ,
And vows to crown himself in Westminster .
His army is a ragged multitude 
Of hinds and peasants , rude and merciless :
Sir Humphrey Stafford and his brother's death 
Hath given them heart and courage to proceed .
All scholars , lawyers , courtiers , gentlemen ,
They call false caterpillars , and intend their death .

O graceless men , they know not what they do .

My gracious lord , retire to Killingworth ,
Until a power be rais'd to put them down .

Ah , were the Duke of Suffolk now alive ,
These Kentish rebels would be soon appeas'd .

Lord Say , the traitors hate thee ,
Therefore away with us to Killingworth .

So might your Grace's person be in danger .
The sight of me is odious in their eyes ;
And therefore in this city will I stay ,
And live alone as secret as I may .


Jack Cade hath gotten London bridge ;
The citizens fly and forsake their houses ;
The rascal people , thirsting after prey ,
Join with the traitor ; and they jointly swear 
To spoil the city and your royal court .

Then linger not , my lord ; away , take horse .

Come , Margaret ; God , our hope , will succour us .

My hope is gone , now Suffolk is deceas'd .

Farewell , my lord : trust not the Kentish rebels .

Trust nobody , for fear you be betray'd .

The trust I have is in mine innocence ,
And therefore am I bold and resolute .


How now , is Jack Cade slain ?

No , my lord , nor likely to be slain ; for they have won the bridge , killing all those that withstand them . The Lord Mayor craves aid of your honour from the Tower , to defend the city from the rebels .

Such aid as I can spare you shall command ;
But I am troubled here with them myself ;
The rebels have assay'd to win the Tower .
But get you to Smithfield and gather head ,
And thither I will send you Matthew Goffe :
Fight for your king , your country , and your lives ;
And so , farewell , for I must hence again .


Now is Mortimer lord of this city . And here , sitting upon London-stone , I charge and command that , of the city's cost , the pissing-conduit run nothing but claret wine this first year of our reign . And now , henceforward , it shall be treason for any that calls me other than Lord Mortimer .


Jack Cade , Jack Cade !

Knock him down there .


If this fellow be wise , he'll never call you Jack Cade more : I think he hath a very fair warning .

My lord , there's an army gathered together in Smithfield .

Come then , let's go fight with them . But first , go and set London-bridge on fire , and , if you can , burn down the Tower too . Come , let's away .


So , sirs :Now go some and pull down the Savoy ; others to the inns of court : down with them all .

I have a suit unto your lordship .

Be it a lordship , thou shalt have it for that word .

Only that the laws of England may come out of your mouth .

Mass , 'twill be sore law then ; for he was thrust in the mouth with a spear , and 'tis not whole yet .

Nay , John , it will be stinking law ; for his breath stinks with eating toasted cheese .

I have thought upon it ; it shall be so . Away , burn all the records of the realm : my mouth shall be the parliament of England .

Then we are like to have biting statutes , unless his teeth be pulled out .

And henceforward all things shall be in common .


My lord , a prize , a prize , here's the Lord Say , which sold the towns in France ; he that made us pay one-and-twenty fifteens , and one shilling to the pound , the last subsidy .


Well , he shall be beheaded for it ten times . Ah , thou say , thou serge , nay , thou buckram lord ; now art thou within pointblank of our jurisdiction regal . What canst thou answer to my majesty for giving up of Normandy unto Monsieur Basimecu , the Dauphin of France , Be it known unto thee by these presence , even the presence of Lord Mortimer , that I am the besom that must sweep the court clean of such filth as thou art . Thou hast most traitorously corrupted the youth of the realm in erecting a grammar-school ; and whereas , before , our fore-fathers had no other books but the score and the tally , thou hast caused printing to be used ; and , contrary to the king , his crown , and dignity , thou hast built a paper-mill . It will be proved to thy face that thou hast men about thee that usually talk of a noun and a verb , and such abominable words as no Christian car can endure to hear . Thou hast appointed justices of peace , to call poor men before them about matters they were not able to answer . Moreover , thou hast put them in prison ; and because they could not read , thou hast hanged them ; when indeed only for that cause they have been most worthy to live . Thou dost ride on a foot-cloth , dost thou not ?

What of that ?

Marry , thou oughtest not to let thy horse wear a cloak , when honester men than thou go in their hose and doublets .

And work in their shirt too ; as myself , for example , that am a butcher .

You men of Kent ,

What say you of Kent ?

Nothing but this : 'tis bona terra , mala gens .

Away with him , away with him , he speaks Latin .

Hear me but speak , and bear me where you will .
Kent , in the Commentaries C sar writ ,
Is term'd the civil'st place of all this isle :
Sweet is the country , because full of riches ;
The people liberal , valiant , active , wealthy ;
Which makes me hope you are not void of pity .
I sold not Maine , I lost not Normandy ;
Yet , to recover them , would lose my life .
Justice with favour have I always done ;
Prayers and tears have mov'd me , gifts could never .
When have I aught exacted at your hands ,
But to maintain the king , the realm , and you ?
Large gifts have I bestow'd on learned clerks ,
Because my book preferr'd me to the king ,
And seeing ignorance is the curse of God ,
Knowledge the wing wherewith we fly to heaven ,
Unless you be possess'd with devilish spirits ,
You cannot but forbear to murder me :
This tongue hath parley'd unto foreign kings 
For your behoof ,

Tut , when struck'st thou one blow in the field ?

Great men have reaching hands : oft have I struck 
Those that I never saw , and struck them dead .

O monstrous coward , what , to come behind folks !

These cheeks are pale for watching for your good .

Give him a box o' the ear , and that will make 'em red again .

Long sitting , to determine poor men's causes ,
Hath made me full of sickness and diseases .

Ye shall have a hempen caudle then , and the help of hatchet .

Why dost thou quiver , man ?.

The palsy , and not fear , provokes me .

Nay , he nods at us ; as who should say , I'll be even with you : I'll see if his head will stand steadier on a pole , or no . Take him away and behead him .

Tell me wherein have I offended most ?
Have I affected wealth , or honour , speak .
Are my chests fill'd up with extorted gold ?
Is my apparel sumptuous to behold ?
Whom have I injur'd , that ye seek my death ?
These hands are free from guiltless bloodshedding ,
This breast from harbouring foul deceitful thoughts .
O , let me live .

I feel remorse in myself with his words ; but I'll bridle it : he shall die , an it be but for pleading so well for his life . Away with him , he has a familiar under his tongue ; he speaks not o' God's name . Go , take him away , I say , and strike off his head presently ; and then break into his son-in-law's house , Sir James Cromer , and strike off his head , and bring them both upon two poles hither .

It shall be done .

Ah , countrymen , if when you make your prayers ,
God should be so obdurate as yourselves ,
How would it fare with your departed souls ?
And therefore yet relent , and save my life .

Away with him , and do as I command ye .

The proudest peer in the realm shall not wear a head on his shoulders , unless he pay me tribute ; there shall not a maid be married , but she shall pay to me her maidenhead , ere they have it ; men shall hold of me in capite ; and we charge and command that their wives be as free as heart can wish or tongue can tell .

My lord , when shall we go to Cheapside and take up commodities upon our bills ?

Marry , presently .

O , brave !


But is not this braver , Let them kiss one another , for they loved well when they were alive . Now part them again , lest they consult about the giving up of some more towns in France . Soldiers , defer the spoil of the city until night : for with these borne before us , instead of maces , will we ride through the streets ; and at every corner have them kiss . Away !


Up Fish Street , down St . Magnus' corner , kill and knock down , throw them into Thames , [A parley sounded , then a retreat .] What noise is this I hear , Dare any be so bold to sound retreat or parley , when I command them kill ?


Ay , here they be that dare and will disturb thee .
Know , Cade , we come ambassadors from the king 
Unto the commons whom thou hast misled ;
And here pronounce free pardon to them all 
That will forsake thee and go home in peace .

What say ye , countrymen , will ye relent ,
And yield to mercy , whilst 'tis offer'd you ,
Or let a rebel lead you to your deaths ?
Who loves the king , and will embrace his pardon ,
Fling up his cap , and say 'God save his majesty !' 
Who hateth him , and honours not his father ,
Henry the Fifth , that made all France to quake ,
Shake he his weapon at us , and pass by .

God save the king , God save the king !

What , Buckingham and Clifford , are ye so brave , And you , base peasants , do ye believe him , will you needs be hanged with your pardons about your necks , Hath my sword therefore broke through London Gates , that you should leave me at the White Hart in Southwark , I thought ye would never have given out these arms till you had recovered your ancient freedom ; but you are all recreants and dastards , and delight to live in slavery to the nobility . Let them break your backs with burdens , take your houses over your heads , ravish your wives and daughters before your faces : for me , I will make shift for one , and so , God's curse light upon you all !

We'll follow Cade , we'll follow Cade !

Is Cade the son of Henry the Fifth ,
That thus you do exclaim you'll go with him ?
Will he conduct you through the heart of France ,
And make the meanest of you earls and dukes ?
Alas , he hath no home , no place to fly to ;
Nor knows he how to live but by the spoil ,
Unless by robbing of your friends and us .
Were't not a shame , that whilst you live at jar ,
The fearful French , whom you late vanquished ,
Should make a start o'er seas and vanquish you ?
Methinks already in this civil broil 
I see them lording it in London streets ,
Crying Villiago , unto all they meet .
Better ten thousand base-born Cades miscarry ,
Than you should stoop unto a Frenchman's mercy .
To France , to France , and get what you have lost ;
Spare England , for it is your native coast .
Henry hath money , you are strong and manly ;
God on our side , doubt not of victory .

A Clifford , a Clifford , we'll follow the king and Clifford .

Was ever feather so lightly blown to and fro as this multitude , The name of Henry the Fifth hales them to a hundred mischiefs , and makes them leave me desolate . I see them lay their heads together to surprise me . My sword make way for me , for here is no staying . In despite of the devils and hell , have through the very middest of you , and heavens and honour be witness , that no want of resolution in me , but only my followers' base and ignominious treasons , makes me betake me to my heels .


What , is he fled , go some , and follow him ;
And he that brings his head unto the king 
Shall have a thousand crowns for his reward .

Follow me , soldiers : we'll devise a mean 
To reconcile you all unto the king .


Was ever king that joy'd an earthly throne ,
And could command no more content than I ?
No sooner was I crept out of my cradle 
But I was made a king at nine months old :
Was never subject long'd to be a king 
As I do long and wish to be a subject .


Health , and glad tidings , to your majesty !

Why , Buckingham , is the traitor Cade surpris'd ?
Or is he but retir'd to make him strong ?


He's fled , my lord , and all his powers do yield ;
And humbly thus , with halters on their necks ,
Expect your highness' doom , of life , or death .

Then , heaven , set ope thy everlasting gates ,
To entertain my vows of thanks and praise !
Soldiers , this day have you redeem'd your lives ,
And show'd how well you love your prince and country :
Continue still in this so good a mind ,
And Henry , though he be infortunate ,
Assure yourselves , will never be unkind :
And so , with thanks and pardon to you all ,
I do dismiss you to your several countries .

God save the king , God save the king !


Please it your Grace to be advertised ,
The Duke of York is newly come from Ireland ;
And with a puissant and a mighty power 
Of Gallowglasses , and stout kerns ,
Is marching hitherward in proud array ;
And still proclaimeth , as he comes along ,
His arms are only to remove from thee 
The Duke of Somerset , whom he terms a traitor .

Thus stands my state , 'twixt Cade and York distress'd ;
Like to a ship , that , having scap'd a tempest ,
Is straight way calm'd , and boarded with a pirate .
But now is Cade driven back , his men dispers'd ;
And now is York in arms to second him .
I pray thee , Buckingham , go and meet him ,
And ask him what's the reason of these arms .
Tell him I'll send Duke Edmund to the Tower ;
And , Somerset , we will commit thee thither ,
Until his army be dismiss'd from him .

My lord ,
I'll yield myself to prison willingly ,
Or unto death , to do my country good .

In any case , be not too rough in terms ;
For he is fierce and cannot brook hard language .

I will , my lord ; and doubt not so to deal 
As all things shall redound unto your good .

Come , wife , let's in , and learn to govern better ;
For yet may England curse my wretched reign .

Fie on ambition , fie on myself , that have a sword , and yet am ready to famish , These five days have I hid me in these woods and durst not peep out , for all the country is laid for me ; but now I am so hungry , that if I might have a lease of my life for a thousand years I could stay no longer . Wherefore , on a brick wall have I climbed into this garden , to see if I can eat grass , or pick a sallet another while , which is not amiss to cool a man's stomach this hot weather . And I think this word 'sallet' was born to do me good : for many a time , but for a sallet , my brain-pan had been cleft with a brown bill ; and many a time , when I have been dry , and bravely marching , it hath served me instead of a quart-pot to drink in ; and now the word 'sallet' must serve me to feed on .


Lord , who would live turmoiled in the court ,
And may enjoy such quiet walks as these ?
This small inheritance my father left me 
Contenteth me , and worth a monarchy .
I seek not to wax great by others' waning ,
Or gather wealth I care not with what envy :
Sufficeth that I have maintains my state ,
And sends the poor well pleased from my gate .

Here's the lord of the soil come to seize me for a stray , for entering his fee-simple without leave . Ah , villain , thou wilt betray me , and get a thousand crowns of the king by carrying my head to him ; but I'll make thee eat iron like an ostrich , and swallow my sword like a great pin , ere thou and I part .

Why , rude companion , whatsoe'er thou be ,
I know thee not ; why then should I betray thee ?
Is't not enough to break into my garden ,
And like a thief to come to rob my grounds ,
Climbing my walls in spite of me the owner ,
But thou wilt brave me with these saucy terms ?

Brave thee , ay , by the best blood that ever was broached , and beard thee too . Look on me well : I have eat no meat these five days ; yet , come thou and thy five men , and if I do not leave you all as dead as a door-nail , I pray God I may never eat grass more .

Nay , it shall ne'er be said , while England stands ,
That Alexander Iden , an esquire of Kent ,
Took odds to combat a poor famish'd man .
Oppose thy steadfast-gazing eyes to mine ,
See if thou canst out-face me with thy looks :
Set limb to limb , and thou art far the lesser ;
Thy hand is but a finger to my fist ;
Thy leg a stick compared with this truncheon ;
My foot shall fight with all the strength thou hast ;
And if mine arm be heaved in the air 
Thy grave is digg'd already in the earth .
As for more words , whose greatness answers words ,
Let this my sword report what speech forbears .

By my valour , the most complete champion that ever I heard , Steel , if thou turn the edge , or cut not out the burly-boned clown in chines of beef ere thou sleep in thy sheath , I beseech Jove on my knees , thou mayst be turned to hobnails .

O , I am slain , Famine and no other hath slain me : let ten thousand devils come against me , and give me but the ten meals I have lost , and I'll defy them all . Wither , garden ; and be henceforth a burying-place to all that do dwell in this house , because the unconquered soul of Cade is fled .

Is't Cade that I have slain , that monstrous traitor ?
Sword , I will hallow thee for this thy deed ,
And hang thee o'er my tomb when I am dead :
Ne'er shall this blood be wiped from thy point ,
But thou shalt wear it as a herald's coat ,
To emblaze the honour that thy master got .

Iden , farewell ; and be proud of thy victory . Tell Kent from me , she hath lost her best man , and exhort all the world to be cowards ; for I , that never feared any , am vanquished by famine , not by valour .


How much thou wrong'st me , heaven be my judge .
Die , damned wretch , the curse of her that bare thee !
And as I thrust thy body in with my sword ,
So wish I I might thrust thy soul to hell .
Hence will I drag thee headlong by the heels 
Unto a dunghill which shall be thy grave ,
And there cut off thy most ungracious head ;
Which I will bear in triumph to the king ,
Leaving thy trunk for crows to feed upon .


From Ireland thus comes York to claim his right ,
And pluck the crown from feeble Henry's head :
Ring , bells , aloud ; burn , bonfires , clear and bright ,
To entertain great England's lawful king .
Ah sancta majestas , who would not buy thee dear ?
Let them obey that know not how to rule ;
This hand was made to handle nought but gold :
I cannot give due action to my words ,
Except a sword , or sceptre balance it .
A sceptre shall it have , have I-a soul ,
On which I'll toss the flower-de-luce of France .


Whom have we here , Buckingham , to disturb me ?

The king hath sent him , sure : I must dissemble .

York , if thou meanest well , I greet thee well .

Humphrey of Buckingham , I accept thy greeting .
Art thou a messenger , or come of pleasure ?

A messenger from Henry , our dread hege ,
To know the reason of these arms in peace ;
Or why thou ,being a subject as I am ,
Against thy oath and true allegiance sworn ,
Shouldst raise so great a power without his leave ,
Or dare to bring thy force so near the court .

Scarce can I speak , my choler is so great :
O , I could hew up rocks and fight with flint ,
I am so angry at these abject terms ;
And now , like Ajax Telamonius ,
On sheep or oxen could I spend my fury .
I am far better born than is the king ,
More like a king , more kingly in my thoughts ;
But I must make fair weather yet awhile ,
Till Henry be more weak , and I more strong .


Buckingham , I prithee , pardon me ,
That I have given no answer all this while ;
My mind was troubled with deep melancholy .
The cause why I have brought this army hither 
Is to remove proud Somerset from the king ,
Seditious to his Grace and to the state .

That is too much presumption on thy part :
But if thy arms be to no other end ,
The king hath yielded unto thy demand :
The Duke of Somerset is in the Tower .

Upon thine honour , is he a prisoner ?

Upon mine honour , he is a prisoner .

Then , Buckingham , I do dismiss my powers .
Soldiers , I thank you all ; disperse yourselves ;
Meet me to-morrow in Saint George's field ,
You shall have pay , and everything you wish ,
And let my sov'reign , virtuous Henry ,
Command my eldest son , nay , all my sons ,
As pledges of my fealty and love ;
I'll send them all as willing as I live :
Lands , goods , horse , armour , anything I have 
Is his to use , so Somerset may die .

York , I commend this kind submission :
We twain will go into his highness' tent .


Buckingham , doth York intend no harm to us ,
That thus he marcheth with thee arm in arm ?

In all submission and humility 
York doth present himself unto your highness .

Then what intend these forces thou dost bring ?

To heave the traitor Somerset from hence ,
And fight against that monstrous rebel , Cade ,
Who since I heard to be discomfited .


If one so rude and of so mean condition 
May pass into the presence of a king ,
Lo , I present your Grace a traitor's head ,
The head of Cade , whom I in combat slew .

The head of Cade , Great God , how just art thou !
O , let me view his visage , being dead ,
That living wrought me such exceeding trouble .
Tell me , my friend , art thou the man that slew him ?

I was , an't like your majesty .

How art thou call'd , and what is thy degree ?

Alexander Iden , that's my name ;
A poor esquire of Kent , that loves his king .

So please it you , my lord , 'twere not amiss 
He were created knight for his good service .

Iden , kneel down .

Rise up a knight .
We give thee for reward a thousand marks ;
And will , that thou henceforth attend on us .

May Iden live to merit such a bounty ,
And never live but true unto his liege !

See , Buckingham , Somerset comes with the queen :
Go , bid her hide him quickly from the duke .


For thousand Yorks he shall not hide his head ,
But boldly stand and front him to his face .

How now , is Somerset at liberty ?
Then , York , unloose thy long-imprison'd thoughts 
And let thy tongue be equal with thy heart .
Shall I endure the sight of Somerset ?
False king , why hast thou broken faith with me ,
Knowing how hardly I can brook abuse ?
King did I call thee , no , thou art not king ;
Not fit to govern and rule multitudes ,
Which dar'st not , no , nor canst not rule a traitor .
That head of thine doth not become a crown ;
Thy hand is made to grasp a palmer's staff ,
And not to grace an awful princely sceptre .
That gold must round engirt these brows of mine ,
Whose smile and frown , like to Achilles' spear ,
Is able with the change to kill and cure .
Here is a hand to hold a sceptre up ,
And with the same to act controlling laws .
Give place : by heaven , thou shalt rule no more 
O'er him whom heaven created for thy ruler .

O monstrous traitor :I arrest thee , York ,
Of capital treason 'gainst the king and crown .
Obey , audacious traitor ; kneel for grace .

Wouldst have me kneel , first let me ask of these 
If they can brook I bow a knee to man .
Sirrah , call in my sons to be my bail :

I know ere they will have me go to ward ,
They'll pawn their swords for my enfranchisement .

Call hither Clifford ; bid him come amain ,
To say if that the bastard boys of York 
Shall be the surety for their traitor father .


O blood-bespotted Neapolitan ,
Outcast of Naples , England's bloody scourge !
The sons of York , thy betters in their birth ,
Shall be their father's bail ; and bane to those 
That for my surety will refuse the boys !


See where they come : I'll warrant they'll make it good .

And here comes Clifford , to deny their bail .

Health and all happiness to my lord the king !

I thank thee , Clifford : say , what news with thee ?
Nay , do not fright us with an angry look :
We are thy sov'reign , Clifford , kneel again ;
For thy mistaking so , we pardon thee .

This is my king , York , I do not mistake ;
But thou mistak'st me much to think I do .
To Bedlam with him , is the man grown mad ?

Ay , Clifford ; a bedlam and ambitious humour 
Makes him oppose himself against his king .

He is a traitor ; let him to the Tower ,
And chop away that factious pate of his .

He is arrested , but will not obey :
His sons , he says , shall give their words for him .

Will you not , sons ?

Ay , noble father , if our words will serve .

And if words will not , then our weapons shall .

Why , what a brood of traitors have we here !

Look in a glass , and call thy image so :
I am thy king , and thou a false-heart traitor .
Call hither to the stake my two brave bears ,
That with the very shaking of their chains 
They may astonish these fell-lurking curs :
Bid Salisbury and Warwick come to me .


Are these thy bears , we'll bait thy bears to death ,
And manacle the bear-ward in their chains ,
If thou dar'st bring them to the baiting-place .

Oft have I seen a hot o'erweening cur 
Run back and bite , because he was withheld ;
Who , being suffer'd with the bear's fell paw ,
Hath clapp'd his tail between his legs , and cried :
And such a piece of service will you do ,
If you oppose yourselves to match Lord Warwick .

Hence , heap of wrath , foul indigested lump ,
As crooked in thy manners as thy shape !

Nay , we shall heat you thoroughly anon .

Take heed , lest by your heat you burn yourselves .

Why , Warwick , hath thy knee forgot to bow ?
Old Salisbury , shame to thy silver hair ,
Thou mad misleader of thy brain-sick son !
What , wilt thou on thy death-bed play the ruffian ,
And seek for sorrow with thy spectacles ?
O , where is faith , O , where is loyalty ?
If it be banish'd from the frosty head ,
Where shall it find a harbour in the earth ?
Wilt thou go dig a grave to find out war ,
And shame thine honourable age with blood ?
Why art thou old , and want'st experience ?
Or wherefore dost abuse it , if thou hast it ?
For shame , in duty bend thy knee to me ,
That bows unto the grave with mickle age .

My lord , I have consider'd with myself 
The title of this most renowned duke ;
And in my conscience do repute his Grace 
The rightful heir to England's royal seat .

Hast thou not sworn allegiance unto me ?

I have .

Canst thou dispense with heaven for such an oath ?

It is great sin to swear unto a sin ,
But greater sin to keep a sinful oath .
Who can be bound by any solemn vow 
To do a murderous deed , to rob a man ,
To force a spotless virgin's chastity ,
To reave the orphan of his patrimony ,
To wring the widow from her custom'd right ,
And have no other reason for this wrong 
But that he was bound by a solemn oath ?

A subtle traitor needs no sophister .

Call Buckingham , and bid him arm himself .

Call Buckingham , and all the friends thou hast ,
I am resolv'd for death , or dignity .

The first I warrant thee , if dreams prove true .

You were best to go to bed and dream again ,
To keep thee from the tempest of the field .

I am resolv'd to bear a greater storm 
Than any thou canst conjure up to-day ;
And that I'll write upon thy burgonet ,
Might I but know thee by thy household badge .

Now , by my father's badge , old Nevil's crest ,
The rampant bear chain'd to the ragged staff ,
This day I'll wear aloft my burgonet ,
As on a mountain-top the cedar shows ,
That keeps his leaves in spite of any storm ,
Even to affright thee with the view thereof .

And from thy burgonet I'll rend thy bear ,
And tread it underfoot with all contempt ,
Despite the bear-ward that protects the bear .

And so to arms , victorious father ,
To quell the rebels and their complices .

Fie , charity , for shame , speak not in spite ,
For you shall sup with Jesu Christ to-night .

Foul stigmatic , that's more than thou canst tell .

If not in heaven , you'll surely sup in hell .


Clifford of Cumberland , 'tis Warwick calls :
And if thou dost not hide thee from the bear ,
Now , when the angry trumpet sounds alarm ,
And dead men's cries do fill the empty air ,
Clifford , I say , come forth , and fight with me !
Proud northern lord , Clifford of Cumberland ,
Warwick is hoarse with calling thee to arms .

How now , my noble lord , what , all afoot ?

The deadly-handed Clifford slew my steed ;
But match to match I have encounter'd him ,
And made a prey for carrion kites and crows 
Even of the bonny beast he lov'd so well .


Of one or both of us the time is come .

Hold , Warwick , seek thee out some other chase ,
For I myself must hunt this deer to death .

Then , nobly , York ; 'tis for a crown thou fight'st .
As I intend , Clifford , to thrive to-day ,
It grieves my soul to leave thee unassail'd .


What seest thou in me , York , why dost thou pause ?

With thy brave bearing should I be in love ,
But that thou art so fast mine enemy .

Nor should thy prowess want praise and esteem ,
But that 'tis shown ignobly and in treason .

So let it help me now against thy sword 
As I in justice and true right express it .

My soul and body on the action both !

A dreadful lay , address thee instantly .

La fin couronne les  uvres .


Thus war hath given thee peace , for thou art still .
Peace with his soul , heaven , if it be thy will !

Shame and confusion , all is on the rout :
Fear frames disorder , and disorder wounds 
Where it should guard . O war , thou son of hell ,
Whom angry heavens do make their minister ,
Throw in the frozen bosoms of our part 
Hot coals of vengeance , Let no soldier fly :
He that is truly dedicate to war 
Hath no self-love ; nor he that loves himself 
Hath not essentially , but by circumstance ,
The name of valour .

O , let the vile world end ,
And the premised flames of the last day 
Knit heaven and earth together ;
Now let the general trumpet blow his blast ,
Particularities and petty sounds 
To cease !Wast thou ordain'd , dear father ,
To lose thy youth in peace , and to achieve 
The silver livery of advised age ,
And , in thy reverence and thy chair-days thus 
To die in ruffian battle , Even at this sight 
My heart is turn'd to stone : and while 'tis mine 
It shall be stony . York not our old men spares :
No more will I their babes : tears virginal 
Shall be to me even as the dew to fire ;
And beauty , that the tyrant oft reclaims ,
Shall to my flaming wrath be oil and flax .
Henceforth I will not have to do with pity :
Meet I an infant of the house of York ,
Into as many gobbets will I cut it 
As wild Medea young Absyrtus did :
In cruelty will I seek out my fame .
Come , thou new ruin of old Clifford's house :

As did  neas old Anchises bear ,
So bear I thee upon my manly shoulders ;
But then  neas bare a living load ,
Nothing so heavy as these woes of mine .

So , lie thou there ;
For underneath an alehouse' paltry sign ,
The Castle in Saint Alban's , Somerset 
Hath made the wizard famous in his death .
Sword , hold thy temper ; heart , be wrathful still :
Priests pray for enemies , but princes kill .

Away , my lord , you are slow : for shame , away !

Can we outrun the heavens , good Margaret , stay .

What are you made of , you'll nor fight nor fly :
Now is it manhood , wisdom , and defence ,
To give the enemy way , and to secure us 
By what we can , which can no more but fly .

If you be ta'en , we then should see the bottom 
Of all our fortunes : but if we haply scape ,
As well we may , if not through your neglect ,
We shall to London get , where you are lov'd ,
And where this breach now in our fortunes made 
May readily be stopp'd .


But that my heart's on future mischief set ,
I would speak blasphemy ere bid you fly ;
But fly you must : uncurable discomfit 
Reigns in the hearts of all our present parts .
Away , for your relief , and we will live 
To see their day and them our fortune give .
Away , my lord , away !


Of Salisbury , who can report of him ;
That winter lion , who in rage forgets 
Aged contusions and all brush of time ,
And , like a gallant in the brow of youth ,
Repairs him with occasion , this happy day 
Is not itself , nor have we won one foot ,
If Salisbury be lost .

My noble father ,
Three times to-day I holp him to his horse ,
Three times bestrid him ; thrice I led him off ,
Persuaded him from any further act :
But still , where danger was , still there I met him ;
And like rich hangings in a homely house ,
So was his will in his old feeble body .
But , noble as he is , look where he comes .


Now , by my sword , well hast thou fought to-day ;
By the mass , so did we all . I thank you , Richard :
God knows how long it is I have to live ;
And it hath pleas'd him that three times to-day 
You have defended me from imminent death .
Well , lords , we have not got that which we have :
'Tis not enough our foes are this time fled ,
Being opposites of such repairing nature .

I know our safety is to follow them ;

For , as I hear , the king is fled to London ,
To call a present court of parliament :
Let us pursue him ere the writs go forth :
What says Lord Warwick , shall we after them ?

After them , nay , before them , if we can .
Now , by my hand , lords , 'twas a glorious day :
Saint Alban's battle , won by famous York ,
Shall be eterniz'd in all age to come .
Sound , drums and trumpets , and to London all :
And more such days as these to us befall !

THE THIRD PART OF KING HENRY VI

I wonder how the king escap'd our hands .

While we pursu'd the horsemen of the north ,
He slily stole away and left his men :
Whereat the great Lord of Northumberland ,
Whose warlike ears could never brook retreat ,
Cheer'd up the drooping army ; and himself ,
Lord Clifford , and Lord Stafford , all abreast ,
Charg'd our main battle's front , and breaking in 
Were by the swords of common soldiers slain .

Lord Stafford's father , Duke of Buckingham ,
Is either slain or wounded dangerously ;
I cleft his beaver with a downright blow :
That this is true , father , behold his blood .


And , brother , here's the Earl of Wiltshire's blood ,

Whom I encounter'd as the battles join'd .

Speak thou for me , and tell them what I did .


Richard hath best deserv'd of all my sons .
But , is your Grace dead , my Lord of Somerset ?

Such hope have all the line of John of Gaunt !

Thus do I hope to shake King Henry's head .

And so do I . Victorious Prince of York ,
Before I see thee seated in that throne 
Which now the house of Lancaster usurps ,
I vow by heaven these eyes shall never close .
This is the palace of the fearful king ,
And this the regal seat : possess it , York ;
For this is thine , and not King Henry's heirs' .

Assist me , then , sweet Warwick , and I will ;
For hither we have broken in by force .

We'll all assist you ; he that flies shall die .

Thanks , gentle Norfolk . Stay by me , my lords ;
And , soldiers , stay and lodge by me this night .

And when the king comes , offer him no violence ,
Unless he seek to thrust you out perforce .


The queen this day here holds her parliament ,
But little thinks we shall be of her council :
By words or blows here let us win our right .

Arm'd as we are , let's stay within this house .

The bloody parliament shall this be call'd ,
Unless Plantagenet , Duke of York , be king ,
And bashful Henry depos'd , whose cowardice 
Hath made us by-words to our enemies .

Then leave me not , my lords ; be resolute ;
I mean to take possession of my right .

Neither the king , nor he that loves him best ,
The proudest he that holds up Lancaster ,
Dares stir a wing if Warwick shake his bells .
I'll plant Plantagenet , root him up who dares .
Resolve thee , Richard ; claim the English crown .


My lords , look where the sturdy rebel sits ,
Even in the chair of state , belike he means 
Back'd by the power of Warwick , that false peer 
To aspire unto the crown and reign as king .
Earl of Northumberland , he slew thy father ,
And thine , Lord Clifford ; and you both have vow'd revenge 
On him , his sons , his favourites , and his friends .

If I be not , heavens be reveng'd on me !

The hope thereof makes Clifford mourn in steel .

What , shall we suffer this , let's pluck him down :
My heart for anger burns ; I cannot brook it .

Be patient , gentle Earl of Westmoreland .

Patience is for poltroons , such as he :
He durst not sit there had your father liv'd .
My gracious lord , here in the parliament 
Let us assail the family of York .

Well hast thou spoken , cousin : be it so .

Ah , know you not the city favours them ,
And they have troops of soldiers at their beck ?

But when the duke is slain they'll quickly fly .

Far be the thought of this from Henry's heart ,
To make a shambles of the parliament-house !
Cousin of Exeter , frowns , words , and threats ,
Shall be the war that Henry means to use .

Thou factious Duke of York , descend my throne ,
And kneel for grace and mercy at my feet ;
I am thy sovereign .

I am thine .

For shame , come down : he made thee Duke of York .

'Twas my inheritance , as the earldom was .

Thy father was a traitor to the crown .

Exeter , thou art a traitor to the crown 
In following this usurping Henry .

Whom should he follow but his natural king ?

True , Clifford ; and that's Richard , Duke of York .

And shall I stand , and thou sit in my throne ?

It must and shall be so : content thyself .

Be Duke of Lancaster : let him be king .

He is both king and Duke of Lancaster ;
And that the Lord of Westmoreland shall maintain .

And Warwick shall disprove it . You forget 
That we are those which chas'd you from the field 
And slew your fathers , and with colours spread 
March'd through the city to the palace gates .

Yes , Warwick , I remember it to my grief ;
And , by his soul , thou and thy house shall rue it .

Plantagenet , of thee , and these thy sons ,
Thy kinsmen and thy friends , I'll have more lives 
Than drops of blood were in my father's veins .

Urge it no more ; lest that instead of words ,
I send thee , Warwick , such a messenger 
As shall revenge his death before I stir .

Poor Clifford , how I scorn his worthless threats .

Will you we show our title to the crown ?
If not , our swords shall plead it in the field .

What title hast thou , traitor , to the crown ?
Thy father was , as thou art , Duke of York ;
Thy grandfather , Roger Mortimer , Earl of March ;
I am the son of Henry the Fifth ,
Who made the Dauphin and the French to stoop ,
And seiz'd upon their towns and provinces .

Talk not of France , sith thou hast lost it all .

The Lord Protector lost it , and not I :
When I was crown'd I was but nine months old .

You are old enough now , and yet , methinks , you lose .
Father , tear the crown from the usurper's head .

Sweet father , do so ; set it on your head .

Good brother , as thou lov'st and honour'st arms ,
Let's fight it out and not stand cavilling thus .

Sound drums and trumpets , and the king will fly .

Sons , peace !

Peace thou , and give King Henry leave to speak .

Plantagenet shall speak first : hear him , lords ;
And be you silent and attentive too ,
For he that interrupts him shall not live .

Think'st thou that I will leave my kingly throne ,
Wherein my grandsire and my father sat ?
No : first shall war unpeople this my realm ;
Ay , and their colours , often borne in France ,
And now in England to our heart's great sorrow ,
Shall be my winding-sheet . Why faint you , lords ?
My title's good , and better far than his .

Prove it , Henry , and thou shalt be king .

Henry the Fourth by conquest got the crown .

'Twas by rebellion against his king .

I know not what to say : my title's weak .


Tell me , may not a king adopt an heir ?

What then ?

An if he may , then am I lawful king ;
For Richard , in the view of many lords ,
Resign'd the crown to Henry the Fourth ,
Whose heir my father was , and I am his .

He rose against him , being his sovereign ,
And made him to resign his crown perforce .

Suppose , my lords , he did it unconstrain'd ,
Think you 'twere prejudicial to his crown ?

No ; for he could not so resign his crown 
But that the next heir should succeed and reign .

Art thou against us , Duke of Exeter ?

His is the right , and therefore pardon me .

Why whisper you , my lords , and answer not ?

My conscience tells me he is lawful king .

All will revolt from me , and turn to him .

Plantagenet , for all the claim thou lay'st ,
Think not that Henry shall be so depos'd .

Depos'd he shall be in despite of all .

Thou art deceiv'd : 'tis not thy southern power ,
Of Essex , Norfolk , Suffolk , nor of Kent ,
Which makes thee thus presumptuous and proud ,
Can set the duke up in despite of me .

King Henry , be thy title right or wrong ,
Lord Clifford vows to fight in thy defence :
May that ground gape and swallow me alive ,
Where I shall kneel to him that slew my father !

O Clifford , how thy words revive my heart !

Henry of Lancaster , resign thy crown .
What mutter you , or what conspire you , lords ?

Do right unto this princely Duke of York ,
Or I will fill the house with armed men ,
And o'er the chair of state , where now he sits ,
Write up his title with usurping blood .


My Lord of Warwick , hear me but one word :
Let me for this my life-time reign as king .

Confirm the crown to me and to mine heirs ,
And thou shalt reign in quiet while thou liv'st .

I am content : Richard Plantagenet ,
Enjoy the kingdom after my decease .

What wrong is this unto the prince your son !

What good is this to England and himself !

Base , fearful , and despairing Henry !

How hast thou injur'd both thyself and us !

I cannot stay to hear these articles .

Nor I .

Come , cousin , let us tell the queen these news .

Farewell , faint-hearted and degenerate king ,
In whose cold blood no spark of honour bides .

Be thou a prey unto the house of York ,
And die in bands for this unmanly deed !

In dreadful war mayst thou be overcome ,
Or live in peace abandon'd and despis'd !


Turn this way , Henry , and regard them not .

They seek revenge and therefore will not yield .

Ah , Exeter .

Why should you sigh , my lord ?

Not for myself , Lord Warwick , but my son ,
Whom I unnaturally shall disinherit .
But be it as it may ; I here entail 
The crown to thee and to thine heirs for ever ;
Conditionally , that here thou take an oath 
To cease this civil war , and , whilst I live ,
To honour me as thy king and sovereign ;
And neither by treason nor hostility 
To seek to put me down and reign thyself .

This oath I willingly take and will perform .


Long live King Henry , Plantagenet , embrace him .

And long live thou and these thy forward sons !

Now York and Lancaster are reconcil'd .

Accurs'd be he that seeks to make them foes !


Farewell , my gracious lord ; I'll to my castle .

And I'll keep London with my soldiers .

And I to Norfolk with my followers .

And I unto the sea from whence I came .


And I , with grief and sorrow , to the court .


Here comes the queen , whose looks bewray her anger :
I'll steal away .


Exeter , so will I .


Nay , go not from me ; I will follow thee .

Be patient , gentle queen , and I will stay .

Who can be patient in such extremes ?
Ah , wretched man ; would I had died a maid ,
And never seen thee , never borne thee son ,
Seeing thou hast prov'd so unnatural a father .
Hath he deserv'd to lose his birthright thus ?
Hadst thou but lov'd him half so well as I ,
Or felt that pain which I did for him once ,
Or nourish'd him as I did with my blood ,
Thou wouldst have left thy dearest heart-blood there ,
Rather than have made that savage duke thine heir ,
And disinherited thine only son .

Father , you cannot disinherit me :
If you be king , why should not I succeed ?

Pardon me , Margaret ; pardon me , sweet son ;
The Earl of Warwick , and the duke , enforc'd me .

Enforc'd thee , art thou king , and wilt be forc'd ?
I shame to hear thee speak . Ah , timorous wretch ;
Thou hast undone thyself , thy son , and me ;
And given unto the house of York such head 
As thou shalt reign but by their sufferance .
To entail him and his heirs unto the crown ,
What is it but to make thy sepulchre ,
And creep into it far before thy time ?
Warwick is chancellor and the Lord of Calais ;
Stern Faulconbridge commands the narrow seas ;
The duke is made protector of the realm ;
And yet shalt thou be safe , such safety finds 
The trembling lamb environed with wolves .
Had I been there , which am a silly woman ,
The soldiers should have toss'd me on their pikes 
Before I would have granted to that act ;
But thou preferr'st thy life before thine honour :
And seeing thou dost , I here divorce myself ,
Both from thy table , Henry , and thy bed ,
Until that act of parliament be repeal'd 
Whereby my son is disinherited .
The northern lords that have forsworn thy colours 
Will follow mine , if once they see them spread ;
And spread they shall be , to thy foul disgrace ,
And utter ruin of the house of York .
Thus do I leave thee . Come , son , let's away ;
Our army is ready ; come , we'll after them .

Stay , gentle Margaret , and hear me speak .

Thou hast spoke too much already : get thee gone .

Gentle son Edward , thou wilt stay with me ?

Ay , to be murder'd by his enemies .

When I return with victory from the field 
I'll see your Grace : till then , I'll follow her .

Come , son , away ; we may not linger thus .


Poor queen , how love to me and to her son 
Hath made her break out into terms of rage .
Reveng'd may she be on that hateful duke ,
Whose haughty spirit , winged with desire ,
Will cost my crown , and like an empty eagle 
Tire on the flesh of me and of my son !
The loss of those three lords torments my heart :
I'll write unto them , and entreat them fair .
Come , cousin ; you shall be the messenger .

And I , I hope , shall reconcile them all .


Brother , though I be youngest , give me leave .

No , I can better play the orator .

But I have reasons strong and forcible .


Why , how now , sons and brother , at a strife ?
What is your quarrel , how began it first ?

No quarrel , but a slight contention .

About what ?

About that which concerns your Grace and us ;
The crown of England , father , which is yours .

Mine , boy , not till King Henry be dead .

Your right depends not on his life or death .

Now you are heir , therefore enjoy it now :
By giving the house of Lancaster leave to breathe ,
It will outrun you , father , in the end .

I took an oath that he should quietly reign .

But for a kingdom any oath may be broken :
I would break a thousand oaths to reign one year .

No ; God forbid your Grace should be forsworn .

I shall be , if I claim by open war .

I'll prove the contrary , if you'll hear me speak .

Thou canst not , son ; it is impossible .

An oath is of no moment , being not took 
Before a true and lawful magistrate 
That hath authority over him that swears :
Henry had none , but did usurp the place ;
Then , seeing 'twas he that made you to depose ,
Your oath , my lord , is vain and frivolous .
Therefore , to arms , And , father , do but think 
How sweet a thing it is to wear a crown ,
Within whose circuit is Elysium ,
And all that poets feign of bliss and joy .
Why do we linger thus , I cannot rest 
Until the white rose that I wear be dy'd 
Even in the lukewarm blood of Henry's heart .

Richard , enough , I will be king , or die .
Brother , thou shalt to London presently ,
And whet on Warwick to this enterprise .
Thou , Richard , shalt unto the Duke of Norfolk ,
And tell him privily of our intent .
You , Edward , shall unto my Lord Cobham ,
With whom the Kentishmen will willingly rise :
In them I trust ; for they are soldiers ,
Witty , courteous , liberal , full of spirit .
While you are thus employ'd , what resteth more ,
But that I seek occasion how to rise ,
And yet the king not privy to my drift ,
Nor any of the house of Lancaster ?

But , stay : what news , why com'st thou in such post ?

The queen with all the northern earls and lords 
Intend here to besiege you in your castle .
She is hard by with twenty thousand men ,
And therefore fortify your hold , my lord .

Ay , with my sword . What , think'st thou that we fear them ?
Edward and Richard , you shall stay with me ;
My brother Montague shall post to London :
Let noble Warwick , Cobham , and the rest ,
Whom we have left protectors of the king ,
With powerful policy strengthen themselves ,
And trust not simple Henry nor his oaths .

Brother , I go ; I'll win them , fear it not :
And thus most humbly I do take my leave .

Sir John , and Sir Hugh Mortimer , mine uncles !
You are come to Sandal in a happy hour ;
The army of the queen mean to besiege us .

She shall not need , we'll meet her in the field .

What , with five thousand men ?

Ay , with five hundred , father , for a need :
A woman's general ; what should we fear ?


I hear their drums ; let's set our men in order ,
And issue forth and bid them battle straight .

Five men to twenty , though the odds be great ,
I doubt not , uncle , of our victory .
Many a battle have I won in France ,
When as the enemy hath been ten to one :
Why should I not now have the like success ?


Ah , whither shall I fly to 'scape their hands ?
Ah , tutor , look , where bloody Clifford comes !


Chaplain , away , thy priesthood saves thy life .
As for the brat of this accursed duke ,
Whose father slew my father , he shall die .

And I , my lord , will bear him company .

Soldiers , away with him .

Ah , Clifford , murder not this innocent child ,
Lest thou be hated both of God and man !


How now , is he dead already , Or is it fear 
That makes him close his eyes , I'll open them .

So looks the pent-up lion o'er the wretch 
That trembles under his devouring paws ;
And so he walks , insulting o'er his prey ,
And so he comes to rend his limbs asunder .
Ah , gentle Clifford , kill me with thy sword ,
And not with such a cruel threatening look .
Sweet Clifford , hear me speak before I die :
I am too mean a subject for thy wrath ;
Be thou reveng'd on men , and let me live .

In vain thou speak'st , poor boy ; my father's blood 
Hath stopp'd the passage where thy words should enter .

Then let my father's blood open it again :
He is a man , and , Clifford , cope with him .

Had I thy brethren here , their lives and thine 
Were not revenge sufficient for me ;
No , if I digg'd up thy forefathers' graves ,
And hung their rotten coffins up in chains ,
It could not slake mine ire , nor ease my heart .
The sight of any of the house of York 
Is as a fury to torment my soul ;
And till I root out their accursed line ,
And leave not one alive , I live in hell .
Therefore 


O , let me pray before I take my death .
To thee I pray ; sweet Clifford , pity me !

Such pity as my rapier's point affords .

I never did thee harm : why wilt thou slay me ?

Thy father hath .

But 'twas ere I was born .
Thou hast one son ; for his sake pity me ,
Lest in revenge thereof , sith God is just ,
He be as miserably slain as I .
Ah , let me live in prison all my days ;
And when I give occasion of offence ,
Then let me die , for now thou hast no cause .

No cause !
Thy father slew my father ; therefore , die .


Dii faciant laudis summa sit ista tu !


Plantagenet , I come , Plantagenet !
And this thy son's blood cleaving to my blade 
Shall rust upon my weapon , till thy blood ,
Congeal'd with this , do make me wipe off both .


The army of the queen hath got the field :
My uncles both are slain in rescuing me ;
And all my followers to the eager foe 
Turn back and fly , like ships before the wind ,
Or lambs pursu'd by hunger-starved wolves .
My sons , God knows what hath bechanced them :
But this I know , they have demean'd themselves 
Like men born to renown by life or death .
Three times did Richard make a lane to me ,
And thrice cried , 'Courage , father , fight it out !' 
And full as oft came Edward to my side ,
With purple falchion , painted to the hilt 
In blood of those that had encounter'd him :
And when the hardiest warriors did retire ,
Richard cried , 'Charge , and give no foot of ground !' 
And cried , 'A crown , or else a glorious tomb !
A sceptre , or an earthly sepulchre !' 
With this , we charg'd again ; but , out , alas !
We bodg'd again : as I have seen a swan 
With bootless labour swim against the tide ,
And spend her strength with over-matching waves .

Ah , hark , the fatal followers do pursue ;
And I am faint and cannot fly their fury ;
And were I strong I would not shun their fury :
The sands are number'd that make up my life ;
Here must I stay , and here my life must end .


Come , bloody Clifford , rough Northumberland ,
I dare your quenchless fury to more rage :

I am your butt , and I abide your shot .

Yield to our mercy , proud Plantagenet .

Ay , to such mercy as his ruthless arm 
With downright payment show'd unto my father .
Now Ph thon hath tumbled from his car ,
And made an evening at the noontide prick .

My ashes , as the ph nix , may bring forth 
A bird that will revenge upon you all ;
And in that hope I throw mine eyes to heaven ,
Scorning whate'er you can afflict me with .
Why come you not , what , multitudes , and fear ?

So cowards fight when they can fly no further ;
So doves do peck the falcon's piercing talons ;
So desperate thieves , all hopeless of their lives ,
Breathe out invectives 'gainst the officers .

O Clifford , but bethink thee once again ,
And in thy thought o'er-run my former time ;
And , if thou canst for blushing , view this face ,
And bite thy tongue , that slanders him with cowardice 
Whose frown hath made thee faint and fly ere this .

I will not bandy with thee word for word ,
But buckle with thee blows , twice two for one .


Hold , valiant Clifford , for a thousand causes 
I would prolong awhile the traitor's life .
Wrath makes him deaf : speak thou , Northumberland .

Hold , Clifford , do not honour him so much 
To prick thy finger , though to wound his heart .
What valour were it , when a cur doth grin ,
For one to thrust his hand between his teeth ,
When he might spurn him with his foot away ?
It is war's prize to take all vantages ,
And ten to one is no impeach of valour .


Ay , ay ; so strives the woodcock with the gin .

So doth the cony struggle in the net .


So triumph thieves upon their conquer'd booty ;
So true men yield , with robbers so o'er-matched .

What would your Grace have done unto him now ?

Brave warriors , Clifford and Northumberland ,
Come , make him stand upon this molehill here ,
That raught at mountains with outstretched arms ,
Yet parted but the shadow with his hand .
What , was it you that would be England's king ?
Was't you that revell'd in our parliament ,
And made a preachment of your high descent ?
Where are your mess of sons to back you now ?
The wanton Edward , and the lusty George ?
And where's that valiant crook-back prodigy ,
Dicky your boy , that with his grumbling voice 
Was wont to cheer his dad in mutinies ?
Or , with the rest , where is your darling Rutland ?
Look , York : I stain'd this napkin with the blood 
That valiant Clifford with his rapier's point 
Made issue from the bosom of the boy ;
And if thine eyes can water for his death ,
I give thee this to dry thy cheeks withal .
Alas , poor York , but that I hate thee deadly ,
I should lament thy miserable state .
I prithee grieve , to make me merry , York .
What , hath thy fiery heart so parch'd thine entrails 
That not a tear can fall for Rutland's death ?
Why art thou patient , man , thou shouldst be mad ;
And I , to make thee mad , do mock thee thus .
Stamp , rave , and fret , that I may sing and dance .
Thou wouldst be fee'd , I see , to make me sport :
York cannot speak unless he wear a crown .
A crown for York , and , lords , bow low to him :
Hold you his hands whilst I do set it on .

Ay , marry , sir , now looks he like a king !
Ay , this is he that took King Henry's chair ;
And this is he was his adopted heir .
But how is it that great Plantagenet 
Is crown'd so soon , and broke his solemn oath ?
As I bethink me , you should not be king 
Till our King Henry had shook hands with death .
And will you pale your head in Henry's glory ,
And rob his temples of the diadem ,
Now in his life , against your holy oath ?
O , 'tis a fault too-too unpardonable .
Off with the crown ; and , with the crown , his head ;
And , whilst we breathe , take time to do him dead .

That is my office , for my father's sake .

Nay , stay ; let's hear the orisons he makes .

She-wolf of France , but worse than wolves of France ,
Whose tongue more poisons than the adder's tooth !
How ill-beseeming is it in thy sex 
To triumph , like an Amazonian trull ,
Upon their woes whom fortune captivates !
But that thy face is , visor-like , unchanging ,
Made impudent with use of evil deeds ,
I would assay , proud queen , to make thee blush :
To tell thee whence thou cam'st , of whom deriv'd ,
Were shame enough to shame thee , wert thou not shameless .
Thy father bears the type of King of Naples ,
Of both the Sicils and Jerusalem ;
Yet not so wealthy as an English yeoman .
Hath that poor monarch taught thee to insult ?
It needs not , nor it boots thee not , proud queen ,
Unless the adage must be verified ,
That beggars mounted run their horse to death .
'Tis beauty that doth oft make women proud ;
But , God he knows , thy share thereof is small :
'Tis virtue that doth make them most admir'd ;
The contrary doth make thee wonder'd at :
'Tis government that makes them seem divine ;
The want thereof makes thee abominable .
Thou art as opposite to every good 
As the Antipodes are unto us ,
Or as the south to the septentrion .
O tiger's heart wrapp'd in a woman's hide !
How couldst thou drain the life-blood of the child ,
To bid the father wipe his eyes withal ,
And yet be seen to bear a woman's face ?
Women are soft , mild , pitiful , and flexible ;
Thou stern , obdurate , flinty , rough , remorseless .
Bidd'st thou me rage , why , now thou hast thy wish :
Wouldst have me weep , why , now thou hast thy will ;
For raging wind blows up incessant showers ,
And when the rage allays , the rain begins .
These tears are my sweet Rutland's obsequies ,
And every drop cries vengeance for his death ,
'Gainst thee , fell Clifford , and thee , false Frenchwoman .

Beshrew me , but his passion moves me so 
That hardly can I check my eyes from tears .

That face of his the hungry cannibals 
Would not have touch'd , would not have stain'd with blood ;
But you are more inhuman , more inexorable ,
O , ten times more , than tigers of Hyrcania .
See , ruthless queen , a hapless father's tears :
This cloth thou dipp'dst in blood of my sweet boy ,
And I with tears do wash the blood away .
Keep thou the napkin , and go boast of this ;

And if thou tell'st the heavy story right ,
Upon my soul , the hearers will shed tears ;
Yea , even my foes will shed fast-falling tears ,
And say , 'Alas , it was a piteous deed !' 
There , take the crown , and , with the crown my curse ,
And in thy need such comfort come to thee 
As now I reap at thy too cruel hand !
Hard-hearted Clifford , take me from the world ;
My soul to heaven , my blood upon your heads !

Had he been slaughter-man to all my kin ,
I should not for my life but weep with him ,
To see how inly sorrow gripes his soul .

What , weeping-ripe , my Lord Northumberland ?
Think but upon the wrong he did us all ,
And that will quickly dry thy melting tears .

Here's for my oath ; here's for my father's death .


And here's to right our gentlehearted king .


Open thy gate of mercy , gracious God !
My soul flies through these wounds to seek out thee .


Off with his head , and set it on York gates ;
So York may overlook the town of York .

I wonder how our princely father 'scap'd ,
Or whether he be 'scap'd away or no 
From Clifford's and Northumberland's pursuit .
Had he been ta'en we should have heard the news ;
Had he been slain we should have heard the news ;
Or had he 'scap'd , methinks we should have heard 
The happy tidings of his good escape .
How fares my brother , why is he so sad ?

I cannot joy until I be resolv'd 
Where our right valiant father is become .
I saw him in the battle range about ,
And watch'd him how he singled Clifford forth .
Methought he bore him in the thickest troop 
As doth a lion in a herd of neat ;
Or as a bear , encompass'd round with dogs ,
Who having pinch'd a few and made them cry ,
The rest stand all aloof and bark at him .
So far'd our father with his enemies ;
So fled his enemies my war-like father :
Methinks , 'tis prize enough to be his son .
See how the morning opes her golden gates ,
And takes her farewell of the glorious sun ;
How well resembles it the prime of youth ,
Trimm'd like a younker prancing to his love .

Dazzle mine eyes , or do I see three suns ?

Three glorious suns , each one a perfect sun ;
Not separated with the racking clouds ,
But sever'd in a pale clear-shining sky .
See , see , they join , embrace , and seem to kiss ,
As if they vow'd some league inviolable :
Now are they but one lamp , one light , one sun .
In this the heaven figures some event .

'Tis wondrous strange , the like yet never heard of .
I think it cites us , brother , to the field ;
That we , the sons of brave Plantagenet ,
Each one already blazing by our meeds ,
Should notwithstanding join our lights together ,
And over-shine the earth , as this the world .
Whate'er it bodes , henceforward will I bear 
Upon my target three fair-shining suns .

Nay , bear three daughters : by your leave I speak it ,
You love the breeder better than the male .


But what art thou , whose heavy looks foretell 

Some dreadful story hanging on thy tongue ?

Ah , one that was a woeful looker-on ,
When as the noble Duke of York was slain ,
Your princely father , and my loving lord .

O , speak no more , for I have heard too much .

Say how he died , for I will hear it all .

Environed he was with many foes ,
And stood against them , as the hope of Troy 
Against the Greeks that would have enter'd Troy .
But Hercules himself must yield to odds ;
And many strokes , though with a little axe ,
Hew down and fell the hardest-timber'd oak .
By many hands your father was subdu'd ;
But only slaughter'd by the ireful arm 
Of unrelenting Clifford and the queen ,
Who crown'd the gracious duke in high despite ;
Laugh'd in his face ; and when with grief he wept ,
The ruthless queen gave him to dry his cheeks ,
A napkin steeped in the harmless blood 
Of sweet young Rutland , by rough Clifford slain :
And after many scorns , many foul taunts ,
They took his head , and on the gates of York 
They set the same ; and there it doth remain ,
The saddest spectacle that e'er I view'd .

Sweet Duke of York , our prop to lean upon ,
Now thou art gone , we have no staff , no stay !
O Clifford , boist'rous Clifford , thou hast slain 
The flower of Europe for his chivalry ;
And treacherously hast thou vanquish'd him ,
For hand to hand he would have vanquish'd thee .
Now my soul's palace is become a prison :
Ah , would she break from hence , that this my body 
Might in the ground be closed up in rest ,
For never henceforth shall I joy again ,
Never , O , never , shall I see more joy .

I cannot weep , for all my body's moisture 
Scarce serves to quench my furnace-burning heart :
Nor can my tongue unload my heart's great burden ;
For self-same wind , that I should speak withal 
Is kindling coals that fire all my breast ,
And burn me up with flames , that tears would quench .
To weep is to make less the depth of grief :
Tears then , for babes ; blows and revenge for me !
Richard , I bear thy name ; I'll venge thy death ,
Or die renowned by attempting it .

His name that valiant duke hath left with thee ;
His dukedom and his chair with me is left .

Nay , if thou be that princely eagle's bird ,
Show thy descent by gazing 'gainst the sun :
For chair and dukedom , throne and kingdom say ;
Either that is thine , or else thou wert not his .


How now , fair lords , What fare , what news abroad ?

Great Lord of Warwick , if we should recount 
Our baleful news , and at each word's deliv'rance 
Stab poniards in our flesh till all were told ,
The words would add more anguish than the wounds .
O valiant lord , the Duke of York is slain .

O Warwick , Warwick , that Plantagenet 
Which held thee dearly as his soul's redemption ,
Is by the stern Lord Clifford done to death .

Ten days ago I drown'd these news in tears ,
And now , to add more measure to your woes ,
I come to tell you things sith then befallen .
After the bloody fray at Wakefield fought ,
Where your brave father breath'd his latest gasp ,
Tidings , as swiftly as the posts could run ,
Were brought me of your loss and his depart .
I , then in London , keeper of the king ,
Muster'd my soldiers , gather'd flocks of friends ,
And very well appointed , as I thought ,
March'd towards Saint Alban's to intercept the queen ,
Bearing the king in my behalf along ;
For by my scouts I was advertised 
That she was coming with a full intent 
To dash our late decree in parliament ,
Touching King Henry's oath and your succession .
Short tale to make , we at Saint Alban's met ,
Our battles join'd , and both sides fiercely fought :
But whether 'twas the coldness of the king ,
Who look'd full gently on his war-like queen ,
That robb'd my soldiers of their heated spleen ;
Or whether 'twas report of her success ;
Or more than common fear of Clifford's rigour ,
Who thunders to his captives blood and death ,
I cannot judge : but , to conclude with truth ,
Their weapons like to lightning came and went ;
Our soldiers' like the night-owl's lazy flight ,
Or like a lazy thresher with a flail 
Fell gently down , as if they struck their friends .
I cheer'd them up with justice of our cause ,
With promise of high pay , and great rewards :
But all in vain ; they had no heart to fight ,
And we in them no hope to win the day ;
So that we fled : the king unto the queen ;
Lord George your brother , Norfolk , and myself ,
In haste , post-haste , are come to join with you ;
For in the marches here we heard you were ,
Making another head to fight again .

Where is the Duke of Norfolk , gentle Warwick ?
And when came George from Burgundy to England ?

Some six miles off the duke is with the soldiers ;
And for your brother , he was lately sent 
From your kind aunt , Duchess of Burgundy ,
With aid of soldiers to this needful war .

'Twas odds , belike , when valiant Warwick fled :
Oft have I heard his praises in pursuit ,
But ne'er till now his scandal of retire .

Nor now my scandal , Richard , dost thou hear ;
For thou shalt know , this strong right hand of mine 
Can pluck the diadem from faint Henry's head ,
And wring the awful sceptre from his fist ,
Were he as famous , and as bold in war 
As he is fam'd for mildness , peace , and prayer .

I know it well , Lord Warwick ; blame me not :
'Tis love I bear thy glories makes me speak .
But , in this troublous time what's to be done ?
Shall we go throw away our coats of steel ,
And wrap our bodies in black mourning gowns ,
Numb'ring our Ave-Maries with our beads ?
Or shall we on the helmets of our foes 
Tell our devotion with revengeful arms ?
If for the last , say 'Ay ,' and to it , lords .

Why , therefore Warwick came to seek you out ;
And therefore comes my brother Montague .
Attend me , lords . The proud insulting queen ,
With Clifford and the haught Northumberland ,
And of their feather many more proud birds ,
Have wrought the easy-melting king like wax .
He swore consent to your succession ,
His oath enrolled in the parliament ;
And now to London all the crew are gone ,
To frustrate both his oath and what beside 
May make against the house of Lancaster .
Their power , I think , is thirty thousand strong :
Now , if the help of Norfolk and myself ,
With all the friends that thou , brave Earl of March ,
Amongst the loving Welshmen canst procure ,
Will but amount to five and twenty thousand ,
Why , Via , to London will we march amain ,
And once again bestride our foaming steeds ,
And once again cry , 'Charge upon our foes !' 
But never once again turn back and fly .

Ay , now methinks I hear great Warwick speak :
Ne'er may he live to see a sunshine day ,
That cries 'Retire ,' if Warwick bid him stay .

Lord Warwick , on thy shoulder will I lean ;
And when thou fail'st as God forbid the hour !
Must Edward fall , which peril heaven forfend !

No longer Earl of March , but Duke of York :
The next degree is England's royal throne ;
For King of England shalt thou be proclaim'd 
In every borough as we pass along ;
And he that throws not up his cap for joy 
Shall for the fault make forfeit of his head .
King Edward , valiant Richard , Montague ,
Stay we no longer dreaming of renown ,
But sound the trumpets , and about our task .

Then , Clifford , were thy heart as hard as steel ,
As thou hast shown it flinty by thy deeds ,
I come to pierce it , or to give thee mine .

Then strike up , drums , God , and Saint George for us !


How now , what news ?

The Duke of Norfolk sends you word by me ,
The queen is coming with a puissant host ;
And craves your company for speedy counsel .

Why then it sorts ; brave warriors , let's away .

Welcome , my lord , to this brave town of York .
Yonder's the head of that arch-enemy ,
That sought to be encompass'd with your crown :
Doth not the object cheer your heart , my lord ?

Ay , as the rocks cheer them that fear their wrack :
To see this sight , it irks my very soul .
Withhold revenge , dear God , 'tis not my fault ,
Nor wittingly have I infring'd my vow .

My gracious liege , this too much lenity 
And harmful pity must be laid aside .
To whom do lions cast their gentle looks ?
Not to the beast that would usurp their den .
Whose hand is that the forest bear doth lick ?
Not his that spoils her young before her face .
Who 'scapes the lurking serpent's mortal sting ?
Not he that sets his foot upon her back .
The smallest worm will turn being trodden on ,
And doves will peck in safeguard of their brood .
Ambitious York did level at thy crown ;
Thou smiling while he knit his angry brows :
He , but a duke , would have his son a king ,
And raise his issue like a loving sire ;
Thou , being a king , bless'd with a goodly son ,
Didst yield consent to disinherit him ,
Which argu'd thee a most unloving father .
Unreasonable creatures feed their young ;
And though man's face be fearful to their eyes ,
Yet , in protection of their tender ones ,
Who hath not seen them , even with those wings 
Which sometime they have us'd with fearful flight ,
Make war with him that climb'd unto their nest ,
Offering their own lives in their young's defence ?
For shame , my liege , make them your precedent .
Were it not pity that this goodly boy 
Should lose his birthright by his father's fault ,
And long hereafter say unto his child ,
'What my great grandfather and grandsire got ,
My careless father fondly gave away ?' 
Ah , what a shame were this . Look on the boy ;
And let his manly face , which promiseth 
Successful fortune , steel thy melting heart 
To hold thine own and leave thine own with him .

Full well hath Clifford play'd the orator ,
Inferring arguments of mighty force .
But , Clifford , tell me , didst thou never hear 
That things ill got had ever bad success ?
And happy always was it for that son 
Whose father for his hoarding went to hell ?
I'll leave my son my virtuous deeds behind ;
And would my father had left me no more !
For all the rest is held at such a rate 
As brings a thousand-fold more care to keep 
Than in possession any jot of pleasure .
Ah , cousin York , would thy best friends did know 
How it doth grieve me that thy head is here !

My lord , cheer up your spirits : our foes are nigh ,
And this soft courage makes your followers faint .
You promis'd knighthood to our forward son :
Unsheathe your sword , and dub him presently .
Edward , kneel down .

Edward Plantagenet , arise a knight ;
And learn this lesson , draw thy sword in right .

My gracious father , by your kingly leave ,
I'll draw it as apparent to the crown ,
And in that quarrel use it to the death .

Why , that is spoken like a toward prince .


Royal commanders , be in readiness :
For with a band of thirty thousand men 
Comes Warwick , backing of the Duke of York ;
And in the towns , as they do march along ,
Proclaims him king , and many fly to him :
Darraign your battle , for they are at hand .

I would your highness would depart the field :
The queen hath best success when you are absent .

Ay , good my lord , and leave us to our fortune .

Why , that's my fortune too ; therefore I'll stay .

Be it with resolution then to fight .

My royal father , cheer these noble lords ,
And hearten those that fight in your defence :
Unsheathe your sword , good father : cry , 'Saint George !' 


Now , perjur'd Henry , wilt thou kneel for grace ,
And set thy diadem upon my head ;
Or bide the mortal fortune of the field ?

Go , rate thy minions , proud insulting boy !
Becomes it thee to be thus bold in terms 
Before thy sovereign and thy lawful king ?

I am his king , and he should bow his knee ;
I was adopted heir by his consent :
Since when , his oath is broke ; for , as I hear ,
You , that are king , though he do wear the crown ,
Have caus'd him , by new act of parliament ,
To blot out me , and put his own son in .

And reason too :
Who should succeed the father but the son ?

Are you there , butcher , O , I cannot speak .

Ay , crook-back ; here I stand to answer thee ,
Or any he the proudest of thy sort .

'Twas you that kill'd young Rutland , was it not ?

Ay , and old York , and yet not satisfied .

For God's sake , lords , give signal to the fight .

What sayst thou , Henry , wilt thou yield the crown ?

Why , how now , long-tongu'd Warwick , dare you speak ?
When you and I met at Saint Alban's last ,
Your legs did better service than your hands .

Then 'twas my turn to fly , and now 'tis thine .

You said so much before , and yet you fled .

'Twas not your valour , Clifford , drove me thence .

No , nor your manhood that durst make you stay .

Northumberland , I hold thee reverently .
Break off the parley ; for scarce I can refrain 
The execution of my big-swoln heart 
Upon that Clifford , that cruel child-killer .

I slew thy father : call'st thou him a child ?

Ay , like a dastard and a treacherous coward ,
As thou didst kill our tender brother Rutland ;
But ere sun-set I'll make thee curse the deed .

Have done with words , my lords , and hear me speak .

Defy them , then , or else hold close thy lips .

I prithee , give no limits to my tongue :
I am a king , and privileg'd to speak .

My liege , the wound that bred this meeting here 
Cannot be cur'd by words ; therefore be still .

Then , executioner , unsheathe thy sword .
By him that made us all , I am resolv'd 
That Clifford's manhood lies upon his tongue .

Say , Henry , shall I have my right or no ?
A thousand men have broke their fasts to-day ,
That ne'er shall dine unless thou yield the crown .

If thou deny , their blood upon thy head ;
For York in justice puts his armour on .

If that be right which Warwick says is right ,
There is no wrong , but everything is right .

Whoever got thee , there thy mother stands ;
For well I wot thou hast thy mother's tongue .

But thou art neither like thy sire nor dam ,
But like a foul misshapen stigmatic ,
Mark'd by the destinies to be avoided ,
As venom toads , or lizards' dreadful stings .

Iron of Naples hid with English gilt ,
Whose father bears the title of a king ,
As if a channel should be call'd the sea ,
Sham'st thou not , knowing whence thou art extraught ,
To let thy tongue detect thy base-born heart ?

A wisp of straw were worth a thousand crowns ,
To make this shameless callet know herself .
Helen of Greece was fairer far than thou ,
Although thy husband may be Menelaus ;
And ne'er was Agamemnon's brother wrong'd 
By that false woman as this king by thee .
His father revell'd in the heart of France ,
And tam'd the king , and made the Dauphin stoop ;
And had he match'd according to his state ,
He might have kept that glory to this day ;
But when he took a beggar to his bed ,
And grac'd thy poor sire with his bridal day ,
Even then that sunshine brew'd a shower for him ,
That wash'd his father's fortunes forth of France ,
And heap'd sedition on his crown at home .
For what hath broach'd this tumult but thy pride ?
Hadst thou been meek our title still had slept ,
And we , in pity of the gentle king ,
Had slipp'd our claim until another age .

But when we saw our sunshine made thy spring ,
And that thy summer bred us no increase ,
We set the axe to thy usurping root ;
And though the edge hath something hit ourselves ,
Yet know thou , since we have begun to strike ,
We'll never leave , till we have hewn thee down ,
Or bath'd thy growing with our heated bloods .

And in this resolution I defy thee ;
Not willing any longer conference ,
Since thou deny'st the gentle king to speak .
Sound trumpets !let our bloody colours wave !
And either victory , or else a grave .

Stay , Edward .

No , wrangling woman , we'll no longer stay :
These words will cost ten thousand lives this day 


Forspent with toil , as runners with a race ,
I lay me down a little while to breathe ;
For strokes receiv'd , and many blows repaid ,
Have robb'd my strong-knit sinews of their strength ,
And spite of spite needs must I rest a while .


Smile , gentle heaven , or strike , ungentle death !
For this world frowns , and Edward's sun is clouded .

How now , my lord , what hap , what hope of good ?


Our hap is loss , our hope but sad despair ,
Our ranks are broke , and ruin follows us .
What counsel give you , whither shall we fly ?

Bootless is flight , they follow us with wings ;
And weak we are and cannot shun pursuit .


Ah , Warwick , why hast thou withdrawn thyself ?
Thy brother's blood the thirsty earth hath drunk ,
Broach'd with the steely point of Clifford's lance ;
And in the very pangs of death he cried ,
Like to a dismal clangor heard from far ,
'Warwick , revenge , brother , revenge my death !' 
So , underneath the belly of their steeds ,
That stain'd their fetlocks in his smoking blood ,
The noble gentleman gave up the ghost .

Then let the earth be drunken with our blood :
I'll kill my horse because I will not fly .
Why stand we like soft-hearted women here ,
Wailing our losses , whiles the foe doth rage ;
And look upon , as if the tragedy 
Were play'd in jest by counterfeiting actors ?
Here on my knee I vow to God above ,
I'll never pause again , never stand still 
Till either death hath clos'd these eyes of mine ,
Of fortune given me measure of revenge .

O Warwick , I do bend my knee with thine ;
And in this vow do chain my soul to thine .
And , ere my knee rise from the earth's cold face ,
I throw my hands , mine eyes , my heart to thee ,
Thou setter up and plucker down of kings ,
Beseeching thee , if with thy will it stands 
That to my foes this body must be prey ,
Yet that thy brazen gates of heaven may ope ,
And give sweet passage to my sinful soul !
Now , lords , take leave until we meet again ,
Where'er it be , in heaven or in earth .

Brother , give me thy hand ; and , gentle Warwick ,
Let me embrace thee in my weary arms :
I , that did never weep , now melt with woe 
That winter should cut off our spring-time so .

Away , away , Once more , sweet lords , farewell .

Yet let us all together to our troops ,
And give them leave to fly that will not stay ,
And call them pillars that will stand to us ;
And if we thrive , promise them such rewards 
As victors wear at the Olympian games .
This may plant courage in their quailing breasts ;
For yet is hope of life and victory .
Forslow no longer ; make we hence amain .


Now , Clifford , I have singled thee alone .
Suppose this arm is for the Duke of York ,
And this for Rutland ; both bound to revenge ,
Wert thou environ'd with a brazen wall .

Now , Richard , I am with thee here alone .
This is the hand that stabb'd thy father York ,
And this the hand that slew thy brother Rutland ;
And here's the heart that triumphs in their death 
And cheers these hands that slew thy sire and brother ,
To execute the like upon thyself ;
And so , have at thee !


Nay , Warwick , single out some other chase ;
For I myself will hunt this wolf to death .


This battle fares like to the morning's war ,
When dying clouds contend with growing light ,
What time the shepherd , blowing of his nails ,
Can neither call it perfect day nor night .
Now sways it this way , like a mighty sea 
Forc'd by the tide to combat with the wind ;
Now sways it that way , like the self-same sea 
Forc'd to retire by fury of the wind :
Sometime the flood prevails , and then the wind ;
Now one the better , then another best ;
Both tugging to be victors , breast to breast ,
Yet neither conqueror nor conquered :
So is the equal poise of this fell war .
Here on this molehill will I sit me down .
To whom God will , there be the victory !
For Margaret my queen , and Clifford too ,
Have chid me from the battle ; swearing both 
They prosper best of all when I am thence .
Would I were dead , if God's good will were so ;
For what is in this world but grief and woe ?
O God , methinks it were a happy life ,
To be no better than a homely swain ;
To sit upon a hill , as I do now ,
To carve out dials quaintly , point by point ,
Thereby to see the minutes how they run ,
How many make the hour full complete ;
How many hours bring about the day ;
How many days will finish up the year ;
How many years a mortal man may live .
When this is known , then to divide the times :
So many hours must I tend my flock ;
So many hours must I take my rest ;
So many hours must I contemplate ;
So many hours must I sport myself ;
So many days my ewes have been with young ;
So many weeks ere the poor fools will ean ;
So many years ere I shall shear the fleece :
So minutes , hours , days , months , and years ,
Pass'd over to the end they were created ,
Would bring white hairs unto a quiet grave .
Ah , what a life were this , how sweet , how lovely !
Gives not the hawthorn bush a sweeter shade 
To shepherds , looking on their silly sheep ,
Than doth a rich embroider'd canopy 
To kings , that fear their subjects' treachery ?
O , yes , it doth ; a thousand-fold it doth .
And to conclude , the shepherd's homely curds ,
His cold thin drink out of his leather bottle ,
His wonted sleep under a fresh tree's shade ,
All which secure and sweetly he enjoys ,
Is far beyond a prince's delicates ,
His viands sparkling in a golden cup ,
His body couched in a curious bed ,
When care , mistrust , and treason wait on him .


Ill blows the wind that profits nobody .
This man whom hand to hand I slew in fight ,
May be possessed with some store of crowns ;
And I , that haply take them from him now ,
May yet ere night yield both my life and them 
To some man else , as this dead man doth me .
Who's this , O God , it is my father's face ,
Whom in this conflict I unwares have kill'd .
O heavy times , begetting such events !
From London by the king was I press'd forth ;
My father , being the Earl of Warwick's man ,
Came on the part of York , press'd by his master ;
And I , who at his hands receiv'd my life ,
Have by my hands of life bereaved him .
Pardon me , God , I knew not what I did !
And pardon , father , for I knew not thee !
My tears shall wipe away these bloody marks ;
And no more words till they have flow'd their fill .

O piteous spectacle , O bloody times !
Whiles lions war and battle for their dens ,
Poor harmless lambs abide their enmity .
Weep , wretched man , I'll aid thee tear for tear ;
And let our hearts and eyes , like civil war ,
Be blind with tears , and break o'ercharg'd with grief .


Thou that so stoutly hast resisted me ,
Give me thy gold , if thou hast any gold ,
For I have bought it with a hundred blows .
But let me see : is this our foeman's face ?
Ah , no , no , no , it is mine only son .
Ah , boy , if any life be left in thee ,
Throw up thine eye : see , see , what showers arise ,
Blown with the windy tempest of my heart ,
Upon thy wounds , that kill mine eye and heart .
O , pity , God , this miserable age .
What stratagems , how fell , how butcherly ,
Erroneous , mutinous , and unnatural ,
This deadly quarrel daily doth beget !
O boy , thy father gave thee life too soon ,
And hath bereft thee of thy life too late .

Woe above woe , grief more than common grief !
O , that my death would stay these ruthful deeds .
O , pity , pity ; gentle heaven , pity .
The red rose and the white are on his face ,
The fatal colours of our striving houses :
The one his purple blood right well resembles ;
The other his pale cheeks , methinks , presenteth :
Wither one rose , and let the other flourish !
If you contend , a thousand lives must wither .

How will my mother for a father's death 
Take on with me and ne'er be satisfied !

How will my wife for slaughter of my son 
Shed seas of tears and ne'er be satisfied !

How will the country for these woeful chances 
Misthink the king and not be satisfied !

Was ever son so ru'd a father's death ?

Was ever father so bemoan'd a son ?

Was ever king so griev'd for subjects' woe ?
Much is your sorrow ; mine , ten times so much .

I'll bear thee hence , where I may weep my fill .


These arms of mine shall be thy winding-sheet ;
My heart , sweet boy , shall be thy sepulchre ,
For from my heart thine image ne'er shall go :
My sighing breast shall be thy funeral bell ;
And so obsequious will thy father be ,
E'en for the loss of thee , having no more ,
As Priam was for all his valiant sons .
I'll bear thee hence ; and let them fight that will ,
For I have murder'd where I should not kill .


Sad-hearted men ,' much overgone with care ,
Here sits a king more woeful than you are .


Fly , father , fly , for all your friends are fled ,
And Warwick rages like a chafed bull .
Away , for death doth hold us in pursuit .

Mount you , my lord ; towards Berwick post amain .
Edward and Richard , like a brace of greyhounds 
Having the fearful flying hare in sight ,
With fiery eyes sparkling for very wrath ,
And bloody steel grasp'd in their ireful hands ,
Are at our backs ; and therefore hence amain .

Away , for vengeance comes along with them .
Nay , stay not to expostulate ; make speed ,
Or else come after : I'll away before .

Nay , take me with thee , good sweet Exeter :
Not that I fear to stay , but love to go 
Whither the queen intends . Forward , away !


Here burns my candle out ; ay , here it dies ,
Which , while it lasted , gave King Henry light .
O Lancaster , I fear thy overthrow 
More than my body's parting with my soul .
My love and fear glu'd many friends to thee ;
And , now I fall , thy tough commixtures melt ,
Impairing Henry , strengthening misproud York :
The common people swarm like summer flies ;
And whither fly the gnats but to the sun ?
And who shines now but Henry's enemies ?
O Ph bus , hadst thou never given consent 
That Ph thon should check thy fiery steeds ,
Thy burning car never had scorch'd the earth ;
And , Henry , hadst thou sway'd as kings should do ,
Or as thy father and his father did ,
Giving no ground unto the house of York ,
They never then had sprung like summer flies ;
I and ten thousand in this luckless realm 
Had left no mourning widows for our death ,
And thou this day hadst kept thy chair in peace .
For what doth cherish weeds but gentle air ?
And what makes robbers bold but too much lenity ?
Bootless are plaints , and cureless are my wounds ;
No way to fly , nor strength to hold out flight :
The foe is merciless , and will not pity ;
For at their hands I have deserv'd no pity .
The air hath got into my deadly wounds ,
And much effuse of blood doth make me faint .
Come , York and Richard , Warwick and the rest ;
I stabb'd your fathers' bosoms , split my breast .

Now breathe we , lords : good fortune bids us pause ,
And smooth the frowns of war with peaceful looks .
Some troops pursue the bloody-minded queen ,
That led calm Henry , though he were a king ,
As doth a sail , fill'd with a fretting gust ,
Command an argosy to stern the waves .
But think you , lords , that Clifford fled with them ?

No , 'tis impossible he should escape ;
For , though before his face I speak the words ,
Your brother Richard mark'd him for the grave ;
And wheresoe'er he is , he's surely dead .


Whose soul is that which takes her heavy leave ?

A deadly groan , like life and death's departing .

See who it is : and now the battle's ended ,
If friend or foe let him be gently us'd .

Revoke that doom of mercy , for 'tis Clifford ;
Who not contented that he lopp'd the branch 
In hewing Rutland when his leaves put forth ,
But set his murd'ring knife unto the root 
From whence that tender spray did sweetly spring ,
I mean our princely father , Duke of York .

From off the gates of York fetch down the head ,
Your father's head , which Clifford placed there ;
Instead whereof let this supply the room :
Measure for measure must be answered .

Bring forth that fatal screech-owl to our house ,
That nothing sung but death to us and ours :
Now death shall stop his dismal threatening sound ,
And his ill-boding tongue no more shall speak .


I think his understanding is bereft .
Speak , Clifford ; dost thou know who speaks to thee ?
Dark cloudy death o'ershades his beams of life ,
And he nor sees , nor hears us what we say .

O , would he did ; and so perhaps he doth :
'Tis but his policy to counterfeit ,
Because he would avoid such bitter taunts 
Which in the time of death he gave our father .

If so thou think'st , vex him with eager words .

Clifford , ask mercy and obtain no grace .

Clifford , repent in bootless penitence .

Clifford , devise excuses for thy faults .

While we devise fell tortures for thy faults .

Thou didst love York , and I am son to York .

Thou pitiedst Rutland , I will pity thee .

Where's Captain Margaret , to fence you now ?

They mock thee , Clifford : swear as thou wast wont .

What , not an oath , nay , then the world goes hard 
When Clifford cannot spare his friends an oath .
I know by that he's dead ; and , by my soul ,
If this right hand would buy two hours' life ,
That I in all despite might rail at him ,
This hand should chop it off , and with the issuing blood 
Stifle the villain whose unstaunched thirst 
York and young Rutland could not satisfy .

Ay , but he's dead : off with the traitor's head ,
And rear it in the place your father's stands .
And now to London with triumphant march ,
There to be crowned England's royal king :
From whence shall Warwick cut the sea to France ,
And ask the Lady Bona for thy queen .
So shalt thou sinew both these lands together ;
And , having France thy friend , thou shalt not dread 
The scatter'd foe that hopes to rise again ;
For though they cannot greatly sting to hurt ,
Yet look to have them buzz to offend thine ears .
First will I see the coronation ;
And then to Brittany I'll cross the sea ,
To effect this marriage , so it please my lord .

Even as thou wilt , sweet Warwick , let it be ;
For on thy shoulder do I build my seat ,
And never will I undertake the thing 
Wherein thy counsel and consent is wanting .
Richard , I will create thee Duke of Gloucester ;
And George , of Clarence ; Warwick , as ourself ,
Shall do and undo as him pleaseth best .

Let me be Duke of Clarence , George of Gloucester ,
For Gloucester's dukedom is too ominous .

Tut , that's a foolish observation :
Richard , be Duke of Gloucester . Now to London ,
To see these honours in possession .

Under this thick-grown hrake we'll shroud ourselves ;
For through this laund anon the deer will come ;
And in this covert will we make our stand ,
Culling the principal of all the deer .

I'll stay above the hill , so both may shoot .

That cannot be ; the noise of thy cross-bow 
Will scare the herd , and so my shoot is lost .
Here stand we both , and aim we at the best :
And , for the time shall not seem tedious ,
I'll tell thee what befell me on a day 
In this self place where now we mean to stand .

Here comes a man ; let's stay till he be past .


From Scotland am I stol'n , even of pure love ,
To greet mine own land with my wishful sight .
No , Harry , Harry , 'tis no land of thine ;
Thy place is fill'd , thy sceptre wrung from thee ,
Thy balm wash'd off wherewith thou wast anointed :
No bending knee will call thee C sar now ,
No humble suitors press to speak for right ,
No , not a man comes for redress of thee ;
For how can I help them , and not myself ?

Ay , here's a deer whose skin's a keeper's fee :
This is the quondam king ; let's seize upon him .

Let me embrace thee , sour adversity ,
For wise men say it is the wisest course .

Why linger we , let us lay hands upon him .

Forbear awhile ; we'll hear a little more .

My queen and son are gone to France for aid ;
And , as I hear , the great commanding Warwick 
Is thither gone , to crave the French king's sister 
To wife for Edward . If this news be true ,
Poor queen and son , your labour is but lost ;
For Warwick is a subtle orator ,
And Lewis a prince soon won with moving words .
By this account then Margaret may win him ,
For she's a woman to be pitied much :
Her sighs will make a battery in his breast ;
Her tears will pierce into a marble heart ;
The tiger will be mild whiles she doth mourn ;
And Nero will be tainted with remorse ,
To hear and see her plaints , her brinish tears .
Ay , but she's come to beg ; Warwick , to give :
She on his left side craving aid for Henry ;
He on his right asking a wife for Edward .
She weeps , and says her Henry is depos'd ;
He smiles , and says his Edward is install'd ;
That she , poor wretch , for grief can speak no more :
Whiles Warwick tells his title , smooths the wrong ,
Inferreth arguments of mighty strength ,
And in conclusion wins the king from her ,
With promise of his sister , and what else ,
To strengthen and support King Edward's place .
O Margaret , thus 'twill be ; and thou , poor soul ,
Art then forsaken , as thou went'st forlorn .

Say , what art thou , that talk'st of kings and queens ?

More than I seem , and less than I was born to :
A man at least , for less I should not be ;
And men may talk of kings , and why not I ?

Ay , but thou talk'st as if thou wert a king .

Why , so I am , in mind ; and that's enough .

But , if thou be a king , where is thy crown ?

My crown is in my heart , not on my head ;
Not deck'd with diamonds and Indian stones ,
Nor to be seen : my crown is call'd content ;
A crown it is that seldom kings enjoy .

Well , if you be a king crown'd with content ,
Your crown content and you must be contented 
To go along with us ; for , as we think ,
You are the king King Edward hath depos'd ;
And we his subjects , sworn in all allegiance ,
Will apprehend you as his enemy .

But did you never swear , and break an oath ?

No , never such an oath ; nor will not now .

Where did you dwell when I was King of England ?

Here in this country , where we now remain .

I was anointed king at nine months old ;
My father and my grandfather were kings ,
And you were sworn true subjects unto me :
And tell me , then , have you not broke your oaths ?

No ;
For we were subjects but while you were king .

Why , am I dead , do I not breathe a man ?
Ah , simple men , you know not what you swear .
Look , as I blow this feather from my face ,
And as the air blows it to me again ,
Obeying with my wind when I do blow ,
And yielding to another when it blows ,
Commanded always by the greater gust ;
Such is the lightness of you common men .
But do not break your oaths ; for of that sin 
My mild entreaty shall not make you guilty .
Go where you will , the king shall be commanded ;
And be you kings : command , and I'll obey .

We are true subjects to the king , King Edward .

So would you be again to Henry ,
If he were seated as King Edward is .

We charge you , in God's name , and in the king's ,
To go with us unto the officers .

In God's name , lead ; your king's name be obey'd :
And what God will , that let your king perform ;
And what he will , I humbly yield unto .


Brother of Gloucester , at Saint Alban's field 
This lady's husband , Sir John Grey , was slain ,
His lands then seiz'd on by the conqueror :
Her suit is now , to repossess those lands ;
Which we in justice cannot well deny ,
Because in quarrel of the house of York 
The worthy gentleman did lose his life .

Your highness shall do well to grant her suit ;
It were dishonour to deny it her .

It were no less : but yet I'll make a pause .

Yea ; is it so ?
I see the lady hath a thing to grant 
Before the king will grant her humble suit .

He knows the game : how true he keeps the wind !

Silence !

Widow , we will consider of your suit ,
And come some other time to know our mind .

Right gracious lord , I cannot brook delay :
May it please your highness to resolve me now ,
And what your pleasure is shall satisfy me .

Ay , widow , then I'll warrant you all your lands ,
An if what pleases him shall pleasure you ,
Fight closer , or , good faith , you'll catch a blow .

I fear her not , unless she chance to fall .

God forbid that , for he'll take vantages .

How many children hast thou , widow , tell me .

I think he means to beg a child of her .

Nay , whip me , then ; he'll rather give her two .

Three , my most gracious lord .

You shall have four , if you'll be rul'd by him .

'Twere pity they should lose their father's lands .

Be pitiful , dread lord , and grant it then .

Lords , give us leave : I'll try this widow's wit .

Ay , good leave have you ; for you will have leave ,
Till youth take leave and leave you to the crutch .


Now , tell me , madam , do you love your children ?

Ay , full as dearly as I love myself .

And would you not do much to do them good ?

To do them good I would sustain some harm .

Then get your husband's lands , to do them good .

Therefore I came unto your majesty .

I'll tell you how these lands are to be got .

So shall you bind me to your highness' service .

What service wilt thou do me , if I give them ?

What you command , that rests in me to do .

But you will take exceptions to my boon .

No , gracious lord , except I cannot do it .

Ay , but thou canst do what I mean to ask .

Why , then I will do what your Grace commands .

He plies her hard ; and much rain wears the marble .

As red as fire , nay , then her wax must melt .

Why stops my lord , shall I not hear my task ?

An easy task : 'tis but to love a king .

That's soon perform'd , because I am a subject .

Why then , thy husband's lands I freely give thee .

I take my leave with many thousand thanks .

The match is made ; she seals it with a curtsy .

But stay thee ; 'tis the fruits of love I mean .

The fruits of love I mean , my loving liege .

Ay , but , I fear me , in another sense .
What love think'st thou I sue so much to get ?

My love till death , my humble thanks , my prayers :
That love which virtue begs and virtue grants .

No , by my troth , I did not mean such love .

Why , then you mean not as I thought you did .

But now you partly may perceive my mind .

My mind will never grant what I perceive 
Your highness aims at , if I aim aright .

To tell thee plain , I aim to lie with thee .

To tell you plain , I had rather lie in prison .

Why , then thou shalt not have thy husband's lands .

Why , then mine honesty shall be my dower ;
For by that loss I will not purchase them .

Therein thou wrong'st thy children mightily .

Herein your highness wrongs both them and me .
But , mighty lord , this merry inclination 
Accords not with the sadness of my suit :
Please you dismiss me , either with 'ay ,' or 'no .' 

Ay , if thou wilt say 'ay' to my request ;
No , if thou dost say 'no' to my demand .

Then , no , my lord . My suit is at an end .

The widow likes him not , she knits her brows .

He is the bluntest wooer in Christendom .

Her looks do argue her replete with modesty ;
Her words do show her wit incomparable ;
All her perfections challenge sovereignty :
One way or other , she is for a king ;
And she shall be my love , or else my queen .
Say that King Edward take thee for his queen ?

'Tis better said than done , my gracious lord :
I am a subject fit to jest withal ,
But far unfit to be a sovereign .

Sweet widow , by my state I swear to thee ,
I speak no more than what my soul intends ;
And that is , to enjoy thee for my love .

And that is more than I will yield unto .
I know I am too mean to be your queen ,
And yet too good to be your concubine .

You cavil , widow : I did mean , my queen .

'Twill grieve your Grace my sons should call you father .

No more than when my daughters call thee mother .
Thou art a widow , and thou hast some children ;
And , by God's mother , I , being but a bachelor ,
Have other some : why , 'tis a happy thing 
To be the father unto many sons .
Answer no more , for thou shalt be my queen .

The ghostly father now hath done his shrift .

When he was made a shriver , 'twas for shift .

Brothers , you muse what chat we two have had .

The widow likes it not , for she looks very sad .

You'd think it strange if I should marry her .

To whom , my lord ?

Why , Clarence , to myself .

That would be ten days' wonder at the least .

That's a day longer than a wonder lasts .

By so much is the wonder in extremes .

Well , jest on , brothers : I can tell you both 
Her suit is granted for her husband's lands .


My gracious lord , Henry your foe is taken ,
And brought as prisoner to your palace gate .

See that he be convey'd unto the Tower :
And go we , brothers , to the man that took him ,
To question of his apprehension .
Widow , go you along . Lords , use her honourably .


Ay , Edward will use women honourably .
Would he were wasted , marrow , bones , and all ,
That from his loins no hopeful branch may spring ,
To cross me from the golden time I look for !
And yet , between my soul's desire and me 
The lustful Edward's title buried ,
Is Clarence , Henry , and his son young Edward ,
And all the unlook'd for issue of their bodies ,
To take their rooms , ere I can place myself :
A cold premeditation for my purpose !
Why then , I do but dream on sovereignty ;
Like one that stands upon a promontory ,
And spies a far-off shore where he would tread ,
Wishing his foot were equal with his eye ;
And chides the sea that sunders him from thence ,
Saying , he'll lade it dry to have his way :
So do I wish the crown , being so far off ,
And so I chide the means that keep me from it ,
And so I say I'll cut the causes off ,
Flattering me with impossibilities .
My eye's too quick , my heart o'erweens too much ,
Unless my hand and strength could equal them .
Well , say there is no kingdom then for Richard ;
What other pleasure can the world afford ?
I'll make my heaven in a lady's lap ,
And deck my body in gay ornaments ,
And witch sweet ladies with my words and looks .
O miserable thought , and more unlikely 
Than to accomplish twenty golden crowns .
Why , love forswore me in my mother's womb :
And , for I should not deal in her soft laws ,
She did corrupt frail nature with some bribe ,
To shrink mine arm up like a wither'd shrub ;
To make an envious mountain on my back ,
Where sits deformity to mock my body ;
To shape my legs of an unequal size ;
To disproportion me in every part ,
Like to a chaos , or an unlick'd bear-whelp 
That carries no impression like the dam .
And am I then a man to be belov'd ?
O monstrous fault , to harbour such a thought .
Then , since this earth affords no joy to me 
But to command , to check , to o'erbear such 
As are of better person than myself ,
I'll make my heaven to dream upon the crown ;
And , whiles I live , to account this world but hell ,
Until my mis-shap'd trunk that bears this head 
Be round impaled with a glorious crown .
And yet I know not how to get the crown ,
For many lives stand between me and home :
And I , like one lost in a thorny wood ,
That rents the thorns and is rent with the thorns ,
Seeking a way and straying from the way ;
Not knowing how to find the open air ,
But toiling desperately to find it out ,
Torment myself to catch the English crown :
And from that torment I will free myself ,
Or hew my way out with a bloody axe .
Why , I can smile , and murder while I smile ,
And cry , 'Content ,' to that which grieves my heart ,
And wet my cheeks with artificial tears ,
And frame my face to all occasions .
I'll drown more sailors than the mermaid shall ;
I'll slay more gazers than the basilisk ;
I'll play the orator as well as Nestor ,
Deceive more slily than Ulysses could ,
And , like a Sinon , take another Troy .
I can add colours to the chameleon ,
Change shapes with Proteus for advantages ,
And set the murd'rous Machiavel to school .
Can I do this , and cannot get a crown ?
Tut , were it further off , I'll pluck it down .

Fair Queen of England , worthy Margaret ,
Sit down with us : it ill befits thy state 
And birth , that thou shouldst stand while Lewis doth sit .

No , mighty King of France : now Margaret 
Must strike her sail , and learn a while to serve 
Where kings command . I was , I must confess ,
Great Albion's queen in former golden days ;
But now mischance hath trod my title down ,
And with dishonour laid me on the ground ,
Where I must take like seat unto my fortune ,
And to my humble seat conform myself .

Why , say , fair queen , whence springs this deep despair ?

From such a cause as fills mine eyes with tears 
And stops my tongue , while heart is drown'd in cares .

Whate'er it be , be thou still like thyself ,
And sit thee by our side .

Yield not thy neck 
To fortune's yoke , but let thy dauntless mind 
Still ride in triumph over all mischance .
Be plain , Queen Margaret , and tell thy grief ;
It shall be eas'd , if France can yield relief .

Those gracious words revive my drooping thoughts ,
And give my tongue-tied sorrows leave to speak .
Now , therefore , be it known to noble Lewis ,
That Henry , sole possessor of my love ,
Is of a king become a banish'd man ,
And forc'd to live in Scotland a forlorn ;
While proud ambitious Edward Duke of York 
Usurps the regal title and the seat 
Of England's true-anointed lawful king .
This is the cause that I , poor Margaret ,
With this my son , Prince Edward , Henry's heir ,
Am come to crave thy just and lawful aid ;
And if thou fail us , all our hope is done .
Scotland hath will to help , but cannot help ;
Our people and our peers are both misled ,
Our treasure seiz'd , our soldiers put to flight ,
And , as thou seest , ourselves in heavy plight .

Renowned queen , with patience calm the storm ,
While we bethink a means to break it off .

The more we stay , the stronger grows our foe .

The more I stay , the more I'll succour thee .

O , but impatience waiteth on true sorrow :
And see where comes the breeder of my sorrow .


What's he , approacheth boldly to our presence ?

Our Earl of Warwick , Edward's greatest friend .

Welcome , brave Warwick , What brings thee to France ?


Ay , now begins a second storm to rise ;
For this is he that moves both wind and tide .

From worthy Edward , King of Albion ,
My lord and sovereign , and thy vowed friend ,
I come , in kindness and unfeigned love ,
First , to do greetings to thy royal person ;
And then to crave a league of amity ;
And lastly to confirm that amity 
With nuptial knot , if thou vouchsafe to grant 
That virtuous Lady Bona , thy fair sister ,
To England's king in lawful marriage .

If that go forward , Henry's hope is done .

And , gracious madam , in our king's behalf ,
I am commanded , with your leave and favour ,
Humbly to kiss your hand , and with my tongue 
To tell the passion of my sov'reign's heart ;
Where fame , late entering at his heedful ears ,
Hath plac'd thy beauty's image and thy virtue .

King Lewis and Lady Bona , hear me speak ,
Before you answer Warwick . His demand 
Springs not from Edward's well-meant honest love ,
But from deceit bred by necessity ;
For how can tyrants safely govern home ,
Unless abroad they purchase great alliance ?
To prove him tyrant this reason may suffice ,
That Henry liveth still ; but were he dead ,
Yet here Prince Edward stands , King Henry's son .
Look , therefore , Lewis , that by this league and marriage 
Thou draw not on thy danger and dishonour ;
For though usurpers sway the rule awhile ,
Yet heavens are just , and time suppresseth wrongs .

Injurious Margaret !

And why not queen ?

Because thy father Henry did usurp ,
And thou no more art prince than she is queen .

Then Warwick disannuls great John of Gaunt ,
Which did subdue the greatest part of Spain ;
And , after John of Gaunt , Henry the Fourth ,
Whose wisdom was a mirror to the wisest ;
And , after that wise prince , Henry the Fifth ,
Who by his prowess conquered all France :
From these our Henry lineally descends .

Oxford , how haps it , in this smooth discourse ,
You told not how Henry the Sixth hath lost 
All that which Henry the Fifth had gotten ?
Methinks these peers of France should smile at that .
But for the rest , you tell a pedigree 
Of threescore and two years ; a silly time 
To make prescription for a kingdom's worth .

Why , Warwick , canst thou speak against thy liege ,
Whom thou obeyedst thirty and six years ,
And not bewray thy treason with a blush ?

Can Oxford , that did ever fence the right ,
Now buckler falsehood with a pedigree ?
For shame , leave Henry , and call Edward king .

Call him my king , by whose injurious doom 
My elder brother , the Lord Aubrey Vere ,
Was done to death , and more than so , my father ,
Even in the downfall of his mellow'd years ,
When nature brought him to the door of death ?
No , Warwick , no ; while life upholds this arm ,
This arm upholds the house of Lancaster .

And I the house of York .

Queen Margaret , Prince Edward , and Oxford ,
Vouchsafe at our request to stand aside ,
While I use further conference with Warwick .


Heaven grant that Warwick's words bewitch him not !

Now , Warwick , tell me , even upon thy conscience ,
Is Edward your true king , for I were loath 
To link with him that were not lawful chosen .

Thereon I pawn my credit and mine honour .

But is he gracious in the people's eye ?

The more that Henry was unfortunate .

Then further , all dissembling set aside ,
Tell me for truth the measure of his love 
Unto our sister Bona .

Such it seems 
As may beseem a monarch like himself .
Myself have often heard him say and swear 
That this his love was an eternal plant ,
Whereof the root was fix'd in virtue's ground ,
The leaves and fruit maintain'd with beauty's sun ,
Exempt from envy , but not from disdain ,
Unless the Lady Bona quit his pain .

Now , sister , let us hear your firm resolve .

Your grant , or your denial , shall be mine :


Yet I confess that often ere this day ,
When I have heard your king's desert recounted ,
Mine ear hath tempted judgment to desire .

Then , Warwick , thus : our sister shall be Edward's ;
And now forthwith shall articles be drawn 
Touching the jointure that your king must make ,
Which with her dowry shall be counterpois'd .
Draw near , Queen Margaret , and be a witness 
That Bona shall be wife to the English king .

To Edward , but not to the English king .

Deceitful Warwick , it was thy device 
By this alliance to make void my suit :
Before thy coming Lewis was Henry's friend .

And still is friend to him and Margaret :
But if your title to the crown be weak ,
As may appear by Edward's good success ,
Then 'tis but reason that I be releas'd 
From giving aid which late I promised .
Yet shall you have all kindness at my hand 
That your estate requires and mine can yield .

Henry now lives in Scotland at his ease ,
Where having nothing , nothing can he lose .
And as for you yourself , our quondam queen ,
You have a father able to maintain you ,
And better 'twere you troubled him than France .

Peace , impudent and shameless Warwick , peace ;
Proud setter up and puller down of kings ;
I will not hence , till , with my talk and tears ,
Both full of truth , I make King Lewis behold 
Thy sly conveyance and thy lord's false love ;
For both of you are birds of self-same feather .


Warwick , this is some post to us or thee .


My lord ambassador , these letters are for you ,
Sent from your brother , Marquess Montague :
These from our king unto your majesty ;


And , madam , these for you ; from whom I know not .


I like it well that our fair queen and mistress 
Smiles at her news , while Warwick frowns at his .

Nay , mark how Lewis stamps as he were nettled :
I hope all's for the best .

Warwick , what are thy news , and yours , fair queen ?

Mine , such as fill my heart with unhop'd joys .

Mine , full of sorrow and heart's discontent .

What , has your king married the Lady Grey ?
And now , to soothe your forgery and his ,
Sends me a paper to persuade me patience ?
Is this the alliance that he seeks with France ?
Dare he presume to scorn us in this manner ?

I told your majesty as much before :
This proveth Edward's love and Warwick's honesty .

King Lewis , I here protest , in sight of heaven ,
And by the hope I have of heavenly bliss ,
That I am clear from this misdeed of Edward's ;
No more my king , for he dishonours me ;
But most himself , if he could see his shame .
Did I forget that by the house of York 
My father came untimely to his death ?
Did I let pass the abuse done to my niece ?
Did I impale him with the regal crown ?
Did I put Henry from his native right ?
And am I guerdon'd at the last with shame ?
Shame on himself , for my desert is honour :
And , to repair my honour , lost for him ,
I here renounce him and return to Henry .
My noble queen , let former grudges pass ,
And henceforth I am thy true servitor .
I will revenge his wrong to Lady Bona ,
And replant Henry in his former state .

Warwick , these words have turn'd my hate to love ;
And I forgive and quite forget old faults ,
And joy that thou becom'st King Henry's friend .

So much his friend , ay , his unfeigned friend ,
That , if King Lewis vouchsafe to furnish us 
With some few bands of chosen soldiers ,
I'll undertake to land them on our coast ,
And force the tyrant from his seat by war .
'Tis not his new-made bride shall succour him :
And as for Clarence , as my letters tell me ,
He's very likely now to fall from him ,
For matching more for wanton lust than honour ,
Or than for strength and safety of our country .

Dear brother , how shall Bona be reveng'd ,
But by thy help to this distressed queen ?

Renowned prince , how shall poor Henry live ,
Unless thou rescue him from foul despair ?

My quarrel and this English queen's are one .

And mine , fair Lady Bona , joins with yours .

And mine with hers , and thine and Margaret's .
Therefore , at last , I firmly am resolv'd 
You shall have aid .

Let me give humble thanks for all at once .

Then , England's messenger , return in post ,
And tell false Edward , thy supposed king ,
That Lewis of France is sending over masquers ,
To revel it with him and his new bride .
Thou seest what's past ; go fear thy king withal .

Tell him , in hope he'll prove a widower shortly ,
I'll wear the willow garland for his sake .

Tell him , my mourning weeds are laid aside ,
And I am ready to put armour on .

Tell him from me , that he hath done me wrong ,
And therefore I'll uncrown him ere't be long .
There's thy reward : be gone .


But , Warwick ,
Thou and Oxford , with five thousand men ,
Shall cross the seas , and bid false Edward battle ;
And , as occasion serves , this noble queen 
And prince shall follow with a fresh supply .
Yet ere thou go , but answer me one doubt :
What pledge have we of thy firm loyalty ?

This shall assure my constant loyalty :
That if our queen and this young prince agree ,
I'll join mine eldest daughter and my joy 
To him forthwith in holy wedlock bands .

Yes , I agree , and thank you for your motion .
Son Edward , she is fair and virtuous ,
Therefore delay not , give thy hand to Warwick ;
And , with thy hand , thy faith irrevocable ,
That only Warwick's daughter shall be thine .

Yes , I accept her , for she well deserves it ;
And here , to pledge my vow , I give my hand .


Why stay we now , These soldiers shall be levied ,
And thou , Lord Bourbon , our high admiral ,
Shall waft them over with our royal fleet .
I long till Edward fall by war's mischance ,
For mocking marriage with a dame of France .


I came from Edward as ambassador ,
But I return his sworn and mortal foe :
Matter of marriage was the charge he gave me ,
But dreadful war shall answer his demand .
Had he none else to make a stale but me ?
Then none but I shall turn his jest to sorrow .
I was the chief that rais'd him to the crown ,
And I'll be chief to bring him down again :
Not that I pity Henry's misery ,
But seek revenge on Edward's mockery .

Now tell me , brother Clarence , what think you 
Of this new marriage with the Lady Grey ?
Hath not our brother made a worthy choice ?

Alas , you know , 'tis far from hence to France ;
How could he stay till Warwick made return ?

My lords , forbear this talk ; here comes the king .

And his well-chosen bride .

I mind to tell him plainly what I think .

Now , brother Clarence , how like you our choice ,
That you stand pensive , as half malcontent ?

As well as Lewis of France , or the Earl of Warwick ;
Which are so weak of courage and in judgment 
That they'll take no offence at our abuse .

Suppose they take offence without a cause ,
They are but Lewis and Warwick : I am Edward ,
Your king and Warwick's , and must have my will .

And you shall have your will , because our king :
Yet hasty marriage seldom proveth well .

Yea , brother Richard , are you offended too ?

Not I :
No , God forbid , that I should wish them sever'd 
Whom God hath join'd together ; ay , and 'twere pity 
To sunder them that yoke so well together .

Setting your scorns and your mislike aside ,
Tell me some reason why the Lady Grey 
Should not become my wife and England's queen :
And you too , Somerset and Montague ,
Speak freely what you think .

Then this is mine opinion : that King Lewis 
Becomes your enemy for mocking him 
About the marriage of the Lady Bona .

And Warwick , doing what you gave in charge ,
Is now dishonoured by this new marriage .

What if both Lewis and Warwick be appeas'd 
By such invention as I can devise ?

Yet to have join'd with France in such alliance 
Would more have strengthen'd this our commonwealth 
'Gainst foreign storms , than any home-bred marriage .

Why , knows not Montague , that of itself 
England is safe , if true within itself ?

Yes ; but the safer when 'tis back'd with France .

'Tis better using France than trusting France :
Let us be back'd with God and with the seas 
Which he hath given for fence impregnable ,
And with their helps only defend ourselves :
In them and in ourselves our safety lies .

For this one speech Lord Hastings well deserves 
To have the heir of the Lord Hungerford .

Ay , what of that , it was my will and grant ;
And for this once my will shall stand for law .

And yet methinks your Grace hath not done well ,
To give the heir and daughter of Lord Scales 
Unto the brother of your loving bride :
She better would have fitted me or Clarence :
But in your bride you bury brotherhood .

Or else you would not have bestow'd the heir 
Of the Lord Bonville on your new wife's son ,
And leave your brothers to go speed elsewhere .

Alas , poor Clarence , is it for a wife 
That thou art malcontent , I will provide thee .

In choosing for yourself you show'd your judgment ,
Which being shallow , you shall give me leave 
To play the broker on mine own behalf ;
And to that end I shortly mind to leave you .

Leave me , or tarry , Edward will be king ,
And not be tied unto his brother's will .

My lords , before it pleas'd his majesty 
To raise my state to title of a queen ,
Do me but right , and you must all-confess 
That I was not ignoble of descent ;
And meaner than myself have had like fortune .
But as this title honours me and mine ,
So your dislikes , to whom I would be pleasing ,
Do cloud my joys with danger and with sorrow .

My love , forbear to fawn upon their frowns :
What danger or what sorrow can befall thee ,
So long as Edward is thy constant friend ,
And their true sovereign , whom they must obey ?
Nay , whom they shall obey , and love thee too ,
Unless they seek for hatred at my hands ;
Which if they do , yet will I keep thee safe ,
And they shall feel the vengeance of my wrath .

I hear , yet say not much , but think the more .


Now , messenger , what letters or what news 
From France ?

My sovereign liege , no letters ; and few words ;
But such as I , without your special pardon ,
Dare not relate .

Go to , we pardon thee : therefore , in brief ,
Tell me their words as near as thou canst guess them .
What answer makes King Lewis unto our letters ?

At my depart these were his very words :
'Go tell false Edward , thy supposed king ,
That Lewis of France is sending over masquers ,
To revel it with him and his new bride .' 

Is Lewis so brave , belike he thinks me Henry .
But what said Lady Bona to my marriage ?

These were her words , utter'd with mild disdain :
'Tell him , in hope he'll prove a widower shortly ,
I'll wear the willow garland for his sake .' 

I blame not her , she could say little less ;
She had the wrong . But what said Henry's queen ?
For I have heard that she was there in place .

'Tell him ,' quoth she , 'my mourning weeds are done ,
And I am ready to put armour on .' 

Belike she minds to play the Amazon .
But what said Warwick to these injuries ?

He , more incens'd against your majesty 
Than all the rest , discharg'd me with these words :
'Tell him from me that he hath done me wrong ,
And therefore I'll uncrown him ere't be long .' 

Ha , durst the traitor breathe out so proud words ?
Well , I will arm me , being thus forewarn'd :
They shall have wars , and pay for their presumption .
But say , is Warwick friends with Margaret ?
