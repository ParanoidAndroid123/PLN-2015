Were I from Dunsinane away and clear ,
Profit again should hardly draw me here .

Cousins , I hope the days are near at hand 
That chambers will be safe .

We doubt it nothing .

What wood is this before us ?

The wood of Birnam .

Let every soldier hew him down a bough 
And bear 't before him : thereby shall we shadow 
The numbers of our host , and make discovery 
Err in report of us .

It shall be done .

We learn no other but the confident tyrant 
Keeps still in Dunsinane , and will endure 
Our setting down before 't .

'Tis his main hope ;
For where there is advantage to be given ,
Both more and less have given him the revolt ,
And none serve with him but constrained things 
Whose hearts are absent too .

Let our just censures 
Attend the true event , and put we on 
Industrious soldiership .

The time approaches 
That will with due decision make us know 
What we shall say we have and what we owe .
Thoughts speculative their unsure hopes relate ,
But certain issue strokes must arbitrate ,
Towards which advance the war .


Hang out our banners on the outward walls ;
The cry is still , 'They come ;' our castle's strength 
Will laugh a siege to scorn ; here let them lie 
Till famine and the ague eat them up ;
Were they not forc'd with those that should be ours ,
We might have met them dareful , beard to beard ,
And beat them backward home .

What is that noise ?

It is the cry of women , my good lord .


I have almost forgot the taste of fears .
The time has been my senses would have cool'd 
To hear a night-shriek , and my fell of hair 
Would at a dismal treatise rouse and stir 
As life were in 't . I have supp'd full with horrors ;
Direness , familiar to my slaughterous thoughts ,
Cannot once start me .

Wherefore was that cry ?

The queen , my lord , is dead .

She should have died hereafter ;
There would have been a time for such a word .
To-morrow , and to-morrow , and to-morrow ,
Creeps in this petty pace from day to day ,
To the last syllable of recorded time ;
And all our yesterdays have lighted fools 
The way to dusty death . Out , out , brief candle !
Life's but a walking shadow , a poor player 
That struts and frets his hour upon the stage ,
And then is heard no more ; it is a tale 
Told by an idiot , full of sound and fury ,
Signifying nothing .

Thou com'st to use thy tongue ; thy story quickly .

Gracious my lord ,
I should report that which I say I saw ,
But know not how to do it .

Well , say , sir .

As I did stand my watch upon the hill ,
I look'd towards Birnam , and anon , methought ,
The wood began to move .

Liar and slave !

Let me endure your wrath if't be not so :
Within this three mile may you see it coming ;
I say , a moving grove .

If thou speak'st false ,
Upon the next tree shalt thou hang alive ,
Till famine cling thee ; if thy speech be sooth ,
I care not if thou dost for me as much .
I pull in resolution and begin 
To doubt the equivocation of the fiend 
That lies like truth ; 'Fear not , till Birnam wood 
Do come to Dunsinane ;' and now a wood 
Comes toward Dunsinane . Arm , arm , and out !
If this which he avouches does appear ,
There is nor flying hence , nor tarrying here .
I 'gin to be aweary of the sun ,
And wish the estate o' the world were now undone .
Ring the alarum-bell , Blow , wind , come , wrack !
At least we'll die with harness on our back .


Now near enough ; your leavy screens throw down ,
And show like those you are . You , worthy uncle ,
Shall , with my cousin , your right-noble son ,
Lead our first battle ; worthy Macduff and we 
Shall take upon 's what else remains to do ,
According to our order .

Fare you well .
Do we but find the tyrant's power to-night ,
Let us be beaten , if we cannot fight .

Make all our trumpets speak ; give them all breath ,
Those clamorous harbingers of blood and death .


They have tied me to a stake ; I cannot fly ,
But bear-like I must fight the course . What's he 
That was not born of woman ? Such a one 
Am I to fear , or none .


What is thy name ?

Thou'lt be afraid to hear it .

No ; though thou call'st thyself a hotter name 
Than any is in hell .

My name's Macbeth .

The devil himself could not pronounce a title 
More hateful to mine ear .

No , nor more fearful .

Thou liest , abhorred tyrant ; with my sword 
I'll prove the lie thou speak'st .


Thou wast born of woman :
But swords I smile at , weapons laugh to scorn ,
Brandish'd by man that's of a woman born .

That way the noise is . Tyrant , show thy face :
If thou be'st slain and with no stroke of mine ,
My wife and children's ghosts will haunt me still .
I cannot strike at wretched kerns , whose arms 
Are hir'd to bear their staves : either thou , Macbeth ,
Or else my sword with an unbatter'd edge 
I sheathe again undeeded . There thou shouldst be ;
By this great clatter , one of greatest note 
Seems bruited . Let me find him , fortune !
And more I beg not .

This way , my lord ; the castle's gently render'd :
The tyrant's people on both sides do fight ;
The noble thanes do bravely in the war ;
The day almost itself professes yours ,
And little is to do .

We have met with foes 
That strike beside us .

Enter , sir , the castle .

Why should I play the Roman fool , and die 
On mine own sword ? whiles I see lives , the gashes 
Do better upon them .


Turn , hell-hound , turn !

Of all men else I have avoided thee :
But get thee back , my soul is too much charg'd 
With blood of thine already .

I have no words ;
My voice is in my sword , thou bloodier villain 
Than terms can give thee out !


Thou losest labour :
As easy mayst thou the intrenchant air 
With thy keen sword impress as make me bleed :
Let fall thy blade on vulnerable crests ;
I bear a charmed life , which must not yield 
To one of woman born .

Despair thy charm ;
And let the angel whom thou still hast serv'd 
Tell thee , Macduff was from his mother's womb 
Untimely ripp'd .

Accursed be that tongue that tells me so ,
For it hath cow'd my better part of man :
And be these juggling fiends no more believ'd ,
That palter with us in a double sense ;
That keep the word of promise to our ear ,
And break it to our hope . I'll not fight with thee .

Then yield thee , coward ,
And live to be the show and gaze o' the time :
We'll have thee , as our rarer monsters are ,
Painted upon a pole , and underwrit ,
'Here may you see the tyrant .' 

I will not yield ,
To kiss the ground before young Malcolm's feet ,
And to be baited with the rabble's curse .
Though Birnam wood be come to Dunsinane ,
And thou oppos'd , being of no woman born ,
Yet I will try the last : before my body 
I throw my war-like shield . Lay on , Macduff ,
And damn'd be him that first cries , 'Hold , enough !' 


I would the friends we miss were safe arriv'd .

Some must go off ; and yet , by these I see ,
So great a day as this is cheaply bought .

Macduff is missing , and your noble son .

Your son , my lord , has paid a soldier's debt :
He only liv'd but till he was a man ;
The which no sooner had his prowess confirm'd 
In the unshrinking station where he fought ,
But like a man he died .

Then he is dead ?

Ay , and brought off the field . Your cause of sorrow 
Must not be measur'd by his worth , for then 
It hath no end .

Had he his hurts before ?

Ay , on the front .

Why then , God's soldier be he !
Had I as many sons as I have hairs ,
I would not wish them to a fairer death :
And so , his knell is knoll'd .

He's worth more sorrow ,
And that I'll spend for him .

He's worth no more ;
They say , he parted well , and paid his score :
And so , God be with him , Here comes newer comfort .


Hail , king , for so thou art . Behold , where stands 
The usurper's cursed head : the time is free :
I see thee compass'd with thy kingdom's pearl ,
That speak my salutation in their minds ;
Whose voices I desire aloud with mine ;
Hail , King of Scotland !

Hail , King of Scotland !


We shall not spend a large expense of time 
Before we reckon with your several loves ,
And make us even with you . My thanes and kinsmen ,
Henceforth be earls , the first that ever Scotland 
In such an honour nam'd . What's more to do ,
Which would be planted newly with the time ,
As calling home our exil'd friends abroad 
That fled the snares of watchful tyranny ;
Producing forth the cruel ministers 
Of this dead butcher and his fiend-like queen ,
Who , as 'tis thought , by self and violent hands 
Took off her life ; this , and what needful else 
That calls upon us , by the grace of Grace 
We will perform in measure , time , and place :
So , thanks to all at once and to each one ,
Whom we invite to see us crown'd at Scone .

OTHELLO, THE MOOR OF VENICE

Tush , Never tell me ; I take it much unkindly 
That thou , Iago , who hast had my purse 
As if the strings were thine , shouldst know of this .

'Sblood , but you will not hear me :
If ever I did dream of such a matter ,
Abhor me .

Thou told'st me thou didst hold him in thy hate .

Despise me if I do not . Three great ones of the city ,
In personal suit to make me his lieutenant ,
Off-capp'd to him ; and , by the faith of man .
I know my price , I am worth no worse a place ;
But he , as loving his own pride and purposes ,
Evades them , with a bombast circumstance 
Horribly stuff'd with epithets of war ;
And , in conclusion ,
Nonsuits my mediators ; for , 'Certes ,' says he ,
'I have already chose my officer .' 
And what was he ?
Forsooth , a great arithmetician ,
One Michael Cassio , a Florentine ,
A fellow almost damn'd in a fair wife ;
That never set a squadron in the field ,
Nor the division of a battle knows 
More than a spinster ; unless the bookish theoric ,
Wherein the toged consuls can propose 
As masterly as he : mere prattle , without practice ,
Is all his soldiership . But he , sir , had the election ;
And I of whom his eyes had seen the proof 
At Rhodes , at Cyprus , and on other grounds 
Christian and heathen must be be-lee'd and calm'd 
By debitor and creditor ; this counter caster ,
He , in good time , must his lieutenant be ,
And I God bless the mark !his Moorship's ancient .

By heaven , I rather would have been his hangman .

Why , there's no remedy : 'tis the curse of the service ,
Preferment goes by letter and affection ,
Not by the old gradation , where each second 
Stood heir to the first . Now , sir , be judge yourself ,
Whe'r I in any just term am affin'd 
To love the Moor .

I would not follow him then .

O , sir , content you ;
I follow him to serve my turn upon him ;
We cannot all be masters , nor all masters 
Cannot be truly follow'd . You shall mark 
Many a duteous and knee-crooking knave ,
That , doting on his own obsequious bondage ,
Wears out his time , much like his master's ass ,
For nought but provender , and when he's old , cashier'd ;
Whip me such honest knaves . Others there are 
Who , trimm'd in forms and visages of duty ,
Keep yet their hearts attending on themselves ,
And , throwing but shows of service on their lords ,
Do well thrive by them , and when they have lin'd their coats 
Do themselves homage : these fellows have some soul ;
And such a one do I profess myself . For , sir ,
It is as sure as you are Roderigo ,
Were I the Moor , I would not be Iago :
In following him , I follow but myself ;
Heaven is my judge , not I for love and duty ,
But seeming so , for my peculiar end :
For when my outward action doth demonstrate 
The native act and figure of my heart 
In compliment extern , 'tis not long after 
But I will wear my heart upon my sleeve 
For daws to peck at : I am not what I am .

What a full fortune does the thick-lips owe ,
If he can carry 't thus !

Call up her father ;
Rouse him , make after him , poison his delight ,
Proclaim him in the streets , incense her kinsmen ,
And , though he in a fertile climate dwell ,
Plague him with flies ; though that his joy be joy ,
Yet throw such changes of vexation on 't 
As it may lose some colour .

Here is her father's house ; I'll call aloud .

Do ; with like timorous accent and dire yell 
As when , by night and negligence , the fire 
Is spied in populous cities .

What , ho , Brabantio , Signior Brabantio , ho !

Awake , what , ho , Brabantio , thieves , thieves , thieves !
Look to your house , your daughter , and your bags !
Thieves , thieves !


What is the reason of this terrible summons ?
What is the matter there ?

Signior , is all your family within ?

Are your doors lock'd ?

Why ? wherefore ask you this ?

'Zounds , sir , you're robb'd ; for shame , put on your gown ;
Your heart is burst , you have lost half your soul ;
Even now , now , very now , an old black ram 
Is tupping your white ewe . Arise , arise !
Awake the snorting citizens with the bell ,
Or else the devil will make a grandsire of you .
Arise , I say .

What , have you lost your wits ?

Most reverend signior , do you know my voice ?

Not I , what are you ?

My name is Roderigo .

The worser welcome :
I have charg'd thee not to haunt about my doors :
In honest plainness thou hast heard me say 
My daughter is not for thee ; and now , in madness ,
Being full of supper and distempering draughts ,
Upon malicious knavery dost thou come 
To start my quiet .

Sir , sir , sir !

But thou must needs be sure 
My spirit and my place have in them power 
To make this bitter to thee .

Patience , good sir .

What tell'st thou me of robbing ? this is Venice ;
My house is not a grange .

Most grave Brabantio ,
In simple and pure soul I come to you .

'Zounds , sir , you are one of those that will not serve God if the devil bid you . Because we come to do you service and you think we are ruffians , you'll have your daughter covered with a Barbary horse ; you'll have your nephews neigh to you ; you'll have coursers for cousins and gennets for germans .

What profane wretch art thou ?

I am one , sir , that comes to tell you , your daughter and the Moor are now making the beast with two backs .

Thou art a villain .

You are a senator .

This thou shalt answer ; I know thee , Roderigo .

Sir , I will answer any thing . But , I beseech you ,
If 't be your pleasure and most wise consent ,
As partly , I find , it is ,that your fair daughter ,
At this odd-even and dull-watch o' the night ,
Transported with no worse nor better guard 
But with a knave of common hire , a gondolier ,
To the gross clasps of a lascivious Moor ,
If this be known to you , and your allowance ,
We then have done you bold and saucy wrongs ;
But if you know not this , my manners tell me 
We have your wrong rebuke . Do not believe ,
That , from the sense of all civility ,
I thus would play and trifle with your reverence :
Your daughter , if you have not given her leave ,
I say again , hath made a gross revolt ;
Tying her duty , beauty , wit and fortunes 
In an extravagant and wheeling stranger 
Of here and every where . Straight satisfy yourself :
If she be in her chamber or your house ,
Let loose on me the justice of the state 
For thus deluding you .

Strike on the tinder , ho !
Give me a taper , call up all my people !
This accident is not unlike my dream ;
Belief of it oppresses me already .
Light , I say , light !


Farewell , for I must leave you :
It seems not meet nor wholesome to my place 
To be produc'd , as , if I stay , I shall ,
Against the Moor ; for , I do know the state ,
However this may gall him with some check ,
Cannot with safety cast him ; for he's embark'd 
With such loud reason to the Cyprus wars ,
Which even now stand in act ,that , for their souls ,
Another of his fathom they have none ,
To lead their business ; in which regard ,
Though I do hate him as I do hell-pains ,
Yet , for necessity of present life ,
I must show out a flag and sign of love ,
Which is indeed but sign . That you shall surely find him ,
Lead to the Sagittary the raised search ;
And there will I be with him . So , farewell .

It is too true an evil : gone she is ,
And what's to come of my despised time 
Is nought but bitterness . Now , Roderigo ,
Where didst thou see her ? O , unhappy girl !
With the Moor , sayst thou ? Who would be a father !
How didst thou know 'twas she ? O , she deceives me 
Past thought . What said she to you ? Get more tapers !
Raise all my kindred , Are they married , think you ?

Truly , I think they are .

O heaven , How got she out ? O , treason of the blood :
Fathers , from hence trust not your daughters' minds 
By what you see them act . Are there not charms 
By which the property of youth and maidhood 
May be abus'd ? Have you not read , Roderigo ,
Of some such thing ?

Yes , sir , I have indeed .

Call up my brother . O , that you had had her .
Some one way , some another , Do you know 
Where we may apprehend her and the Moor ?

I think I can discover him , if you please 
To get good guard and go along with me .

Pray you , lead on . At every house I'll call ;
I may command at most . Get weapons , ho !
And raise some special officers of night .
On , good Roderigo ; I'll deserve your pains .


Though in the trade of war I have slain men ,
Yet do I hold it very stuff o' the conscience 
To do no contriv'd murder : I lack iniquity 
Sometimes to do me service . Nine or ten times 
I had thought to have yerk'd him here under the ribs .

'Tis better as it is .

Nay , but he prated ,
And spoke such scurvy and provoking terms 
Against your honour 
That , with the little godliness I have ,
I did full hard forbear him . But , I pray , sir ,
Are you fast married ? Be assur'd of this ,
That the magnifico is much belov'd ,
And hath in his effect a voice potential 
As double as the duke's ; he will divorce you ,
Or put upon you what restraint and grievance 
The law with all his might to enforce it on 
Will give him cable .

Let him do his spite :
My services which I have done the signiory 
Shall out-tongue his complaints . 'Tis yet to know ,
Which when I know that boasting is an honour 
I shall promulgate , I fetch my life and being 
From men of royal siege , and my demerits 
May speak unbonneted to as proud a fortune 
As this that I have reach'd ; for know , Iago ,
But that I love the gentle Desdemona ,
I would not my unhoused free condition 
Put into circumscription and confine 
For the sea's worth . But , look , what lights come yond ?

Those are the raised father and his friends :
You were best go in .

Not I ; I must be found :
My parts , my title , and my perfect soul 
Shall manifest me rightly . Is it they ?

By Janus , I think no .


The servants of the duke , and my lieutenant .
The goodness of the night upon you , friends !
What is the news ?

The duke does greet you , general ,
And he requires your haste-post-haste appearance ,
Even on the instant .

What is the matter , think you ?

Something from Cyprus , as I may divine .
It is a business of some heat ; the galleys 
Have sent a dozen sequent messengers 
This very night at one another's heels ,
And many of the consuls , rais'd and met ,
Are at the duke's already . You have been hotly call'd for ;
When , being not at your lodging to be found ,
The senate hath sent about three several quests 
To search you out .

'Tis well I am found by you .
I will but spend a word here in the house ,
And go with you .


Ancient , what makes he here ?

Faith , he to-night hath boarded a land carrack ;
If it prove lawful prize , he's made for ever .

I do not understand .

He's married .

To who ?


Marry , to Come , captain , will you go ?

Have with you .

Here comes another troop to seek for you .

It is Brabantio . General , be advis'd ;
He comes to bad intent .


Holla , stand there !

Signior , it is the Moor .

Down with him , thief !


You , Roderigo , come , sir , I am for you .

Keep up your bright swords , for the dew will rust them .
Good signior , you shall more command with years 
Than with your weapons .

O thou foul thief , where hast thou stow'd my daughter ?
Damn'd as thou art , thou hast enchanted her ;
For I'll refer me to all things of sense ,
If she in chains of magic were not bound ,
Whether a maid so tender , fair , and happy ,
So opposite to marriage that she shunn'd 
The wealthy curled darlings of our nation ,
Would ever have , to incur a general mock ,
Run from her guardage to the sooty bosom 
Of such a thing as thou ; to fear , not to delight .
Judge me the world , if 'tis not gross in sense 
That thou hast practis'd on her with foul charms ,
Abus'd her delicate youth with drugs or minerals 
That weaken motion : I'll have 't disputed on ;
'Tis probable , and palpable to thinking .
I therefore apprehend and do attach thee 
For an abuser of the world , a practiser 
Of arts inhibited and out of warrant .
Lay hold upon him : if he do resist ,
Subdue him at his peril .

Hold your hands ,
Both you of my inclining , and the rest :
Were it my cue to fight , I should have known it 
Without a prompter . Where will you that I go 
To answer this your charge ?

To prison ; till fit time 
Of law and course of direct session 
Call thee to answer .

What if I do obey ?
How may the duke be therewith satisfied ,
Whose messengers are here about my side ,
Upon some present business of the state 
To bring me to him ?

'Tis true , most worthy signior ;
The duke's in council , and your noble self ,
I am sure , is sent for .

How , the duke in council !
In this time of the night , Bring him away .
Mine's not an idle cause : the duke himself ,
Or any of my brothers of the state ,
Cannot but feel this wrong as 'twere their own ;
For if such actions may have passage free ,
Bond-slaves and pagans shall our statesmen be .

There is no composition in these news 
That gives them credit .

Indeed , they are disproportion'd ;
My letters say a hundred and seven galleys .

And mine , a hundred and forty .

And mine , two hundred :
But though they jump not on a just account ,
As in these cases , where the aim reports ,
'Tis oft with difference ,yet do they all confirm 
A Turkish fleet , and bearing up to Cyprus .

Nay , it is possible enough to judgment :
I do not so secure me in the error ,
But the main article I do approve 
In fearful sense .

What , ho , what , ho , what , ho !

A messenger from the galleys .


Now , what's the business ?

The Turkish preparation makes for Rhodes ;
So was I bid report here to the state 
By Signior Angelo .

How say you by this change ?

This cannot be ,
By no assay of reason ; 'tis a pageant 
To keep us in false gaze . When we consider 
The importancy of Cyprus to the Turk ,
And let ourselves again but understand ,
That as it more concerns the Turk than Rhodes ,
So may he with more facile question bear it ,
For that it stands not in such war-like brace ,
But altogether lacks the abilities 
That Rhodes is dress'd in : if we make thought of this ,
We must not think the Turk is so unskilful 
To leave that latest which concerns him first ,
Neglecting an attempt of ease and gain ,
To wake and wage a danger profitless .

Nay , in all confidence , he's not for Rhodes .

Here is more news .


The Ottomites , reverend and gracious ,
Steering with due course toward the isle of Rhodes ,
Have there injointed them with an after fleet .

Ay , so I thought . How many , as you guess ?

Of thirty sail ; and now they do re-stem 
Their backward course , bearing with frank appearance 
Their purposes toward Cyprus . Signior Montano ,
Your trusty and most valiant servitor ,
With his free duty recommends you thus ,
And prays you to believe him .

'Tis certain then , for Cyprus .
Marcus Luccicos , is not he in town ?

He's now in Florence .

Write from us to him ; post-post-haste dispatch .

Here comes Brabantio and the valiant Moor .


Valiant Othello , we must straight employ you 
Against the general enemy Ottoman .


I did not see you ; welcome , gentle signior ;
We lack'd your counsel and your help to-night .

So did I yours . Good your grace , pardon me ;
Neither my place nor aught I heard of business 
Hath rais'd me from my bed , nor doth the general care 
Take hold of me , for my particular grief 
Is of so flood-gate and o'erbearing nature 
That it engluts and swallows other sorrows 
And it is still itself .

Why , what's the matter ?

My daughter , O , my daughter .

Dead ?

Dead ?

Ay , to me ;
She is abus'd , stol'n from me , and corrupted 
By spells and medicines bought of mounte-banks ;
For nature so preposterously to err ,
Being not deficient , blind , or lame of sense ,
Sans witchcraft could not .

Whoe'er he be that in this foul proceeding 
Hath thus beguil'd your daughter of herself 
And you of her , the bloody book of law 
You shall yourself read in the bitter letter 
After your own sense ; yea , though our proper son 
Stood in your action .

Humbly I thank your Grace .
Here is the man , this Moor ; whom now , it seems ,
Your special mandate for the state affairs ,
Hath hither brought .

We are very sorry for it .

We are very sorry for it .

What , in your own part , can you say to this ?

Nothing , but this is so .

Most potent , grave , and reverend signiors ,
My very noble and approv'd good masters ,
That I have ta'en away this old man's daughter ,
It is most true ; true , I have married her :
The very head and front of my offending 
Hath this extent , no more . Rude am I in my speech ,
And little bless'd with the soft phrase of peace ;
For since these arms of mine had seven years' pith ,
Till now some nine moons wasted , they have us'd 
Their dearest action in the tented field ;
And little of this great world can I speak ,
More than pertains to feats of broil and battle ;
And therefore little shall I grace my cause 
In speaking for myself . Yet , by your gracious patience ,
I will a round unvarnish'd tale deliver 
Of my whole course of love ; what drugs , what charms ,
What conjuration , and what mighty magic ,
For such proceeding I am charg'd withal ,
I won his daughter .

A maiden never bold ;
Of spirit so still and quiet , that her motion 
Blush'd at herself ; and she , in spite of nature ,
Of years , of country , credit , every thing ,
To fall in love with what she fear'd to look on !
It is a judgment maim'd and most imperfect 
That will confess perfection so could err 
Against all rules of nature , and must be driven 
To find out practices of cunning hell ,
Why this should be . I therefore vouch again 
That with some mixtures powerful o'er the blood ,
Or with some dram conjur'd to this effect ,
He wrought upon her .

To vouch this , is no proof ,
Without more certain and more overt test 
Than these thin habits and poor likelihoods 
Of modern seeming do prefer against him .

But , Othello , speak :
Did you by indirect and forced courses 
Subdue and poison this young maid's affections ;
Or came it by request and such fair question 
As soul to soul affordeth ?

I do beseech you ,
Send for the lady to the Sagittary ,
And let her speak of me before her father :
If you do find me foul in her report ,
The trust , the office I do hold of you ,
Not only take away , but let your sentence 
Even fall upon my life .

Fetch Desdemona hither .

Ancient , conduct them ; you best know the place .

And , till she come , as truly as to heaven 
I do confess the vices of my blood ,
So justly to your grave ears I'll present 
How I did thrive in this fair lady's love ,
And she in mine .

Say it , Othello .

Her father lov'd me ; oft invited me ;
Still question'd me the story of my life 
From year to year , the battles , sieges , fortunes 
That I have pass'd .
I ran it through , even from my boyish days 
To the very moment that he bade me tell it ;
Wherein I spake of most disastrous chances ,
Of moving accidents by flood and field ,
Of hair-breadth 'scapes i' the imminent deadly breach ,
Of being taken by the insolent foe 
And sold to slavery , of my redemption thence 
And portance in my travel's history ;
Wherein of antres vast and desarts idle ,
Rough quarries , rocks and hills whose heads touch heaven ,
It was my hint to speak , such was the process ;
And of the Cannibals that each other eat ,
The Anthropophagi , and men whose heads 
Do grow beneath their shoulders . This to hear 
Would Desdemona seriously incline ;
But still the house-affairs would draw her thence ;
Which ever as she could with haste dispatch ,
She'd come again , and with a greedy ear 
Devour up my discourse . Which I observing ,
Took once a pliant hour , and found good means 
To draw from her a prayer of earnest heart 
That I would all my pilgrimage dilate ,
Whereof by parcels she had something heard ,
But not intentively : I did consent ;
And often did beguile her of her tears ,
When I did speak of some distressful stroke 
That my youth suffer'd . My story being done ,
She gave me for my pains a world of sighs :
She swore , in faith , 'twas strange , 'twas passing strange ;
'Twas pitiful , 'twas wondrous pitiful :
She wish'd she had not heard it , yet she wish'd 
That heaven had made her such a man ; she thank'd me ,
And bade me , if I had a friend that lov'd her ,
I should but teach him how to tell my story ,
And that would woo her . Upon this hint I spake :
She lov'd me for the dangers I had pass'd ,
And I lov'd her that she did pity them .
This only is the witchcraft I have us'd :
Here comes the lady ; let her witness it .


I think this tale would win my daughter too .
Good Brabantio ,
Take up this mangled matter at the best ;
Men do their broken weapons rather use 
Than their bare hands .

I pray you , hear her speak :
If she confess that she was half the wooer ,
Destruction on my head , if my bad blame 
Light on the man , Come hither , gentle mistress :
Do you perceive in all this noble company 
Where most you owe obedience ?

My noble father ,
I do perceive here a divided duty :
To you I am bound for life and education ;
My life and education both do learn me 
How to respect you ; you are the lord of duty ,
I am hitherto your daughter : but here's my husband ;
And so much duty as my mother show'd 
To you , preferring you before her father ,
So much I challenge that I may profess 
Due to the Moor my lord .

God be with you , I have done .
Please it your Grace , on to the state affairs :
I had rather to adopt a child than get it .
Come hither , Moor :
I here do give thee that with all my heart 
Which , but thou hast already , with all my heart 
I would keep from thee . For your sake , jewel ,
I am glad at soul I have no other child ;
For thy escape would teach me tyranny ,
To hang clogs on them . I have done , my lord .

Let me speak like yourself and lay a sentence ,
Which as a grize or step , may help these lovers 
Into your favour .
When remedies are past , the griefs are ended 
By seeing the worst , which late on hopes depended .
To mourn a mischief that is past and gone 
Is the next way to draw new mischief on .
What cannot be preserv'd when Fortune takes ,
Patience her injury a mockery makes .
The robb'd that smiles steals something from the thief ;
He robs himself that spends a bootless grief .

So let the Turk of Cyprus us beguile ;
We lose it not so long as we can smile .
He bears the sentence well that nothing bears 
But the free comfort which from thence he hears ;
But he bears both the sentence and the sorrow 
That , to pay grief , must of poor patience borrow .
These sentences , to sugar , or to gall ,
Being strong on both sides , are equivocal :
But words are words ; I never yet did hear 
That the bruis'd heart was pierced through the ear .
I humbly beseech you , proceed to the affairs of state .

The Turk with a most mighty preparation makes for Cyprus . Othello , the fortitude of the place is best known to you ; and though we have there a substitute of most allowed sufficiency , yet opinion , a sovereign mistress of effects , throws a more safer voice on you : you must therefore be content to slubber the gloss of your new fortunes with this more stubborn and boisterous expedition .

The tyrant custom , most grave senators ,
Hath made the flinty and steel couch of war 
My thrice-driven bed of down : I do agnize 
A natural and prompt alacrity 
I find in hardness , and do undertake 
These present wars against the Ottomites .
Most humbly therefore bending to your state ,
I crave fit disposition for my wife ,
Due reference of place and exhibition ,
With such accommodation and besort 
As levels with her breeding .

If you please ,
Be 't at her father's .

I'll not have it so .

Nor I .

Nor I ; I would not there reside ,
To put my father in impatient thoughts 
By being in his eye . Most gracious duke ,
To my unfolding lend your gracious ear ;
And let me find a charter in your voice 
To assist my simpleness .

What would you , Desdemona ?

That I did love the Moor to live with him ,
My downright violence and storm of fortunes 
May trumpet to the world ; my heart's subdu'd 
Even to the very quality of my lord ;
I saw Othello's visage in his mind ,
And to his honours and his valiant parts 
Did I my soul and fortunes consecrate .
So that , dear lords , if I be left behind ,
A moth of peace , and he go to the war ,
The rites for which I love him are bereft me ,
And I a heavy interim shall support 
By his dear absence . Let me go with him .

Let her have your voices .
Vouch with me , heaven , I therefore beg it not 
To please the palate of my appetite ,
Nor to comply with heat ,the young affects 
In me defunct ,and proper satisfaction ,
But to be free and bounteous to her mind ;
And heaven defend your good souls that you think 
I will your serious and great business scant 
For she is with me . No , when light-wing'd toys 
Of feather'd Cupid seel with wanton dulness 
My speculative and offic'd instruments ,
That my disports corrupt and taint my business ,
Let housewives make a skillet of my helm ,
And all indign and base adversities 
Make head against my estimation !

Be it as you shall privately determine ,
Either for her stay or going . The affair cries haste ,
And speed must answer it .

You must away to-night .

With all my heart .

At nine i' the morning here we'll meet again .
Othello , leave some officer behind ,
And he shall our commission bring to you ;
With such things else of quality and respect 
As doth import you .

So please your Grace , my ancient ;
A man he is of honesty and trust :
To his conveyance I assign my wife ,
With what else needful your good grace shall think 
To be sent after me .

Let it be so .
Good night to every one .

And , noble signior ,
If virtue no delighted beauty lack ,
Your son-in-law is far more fair than black .

Adieu , brave Moor , use Desdemona well .

Look to her , Moor , if thou hast eyes to see :
She has deceiv'd her father , and may thee .


My life upon her faith , Honest Iago ,
My Desdemona must I leave to thee :
I prithee , let thy wife attend on her ;
And bring them after in the best advantage .
Come , Desdemona ; I have but an hour 
Of love , of worldly matters and direction ,
To spend with thee : we must obey the time .


Iago !

What sayst thou , noble heart ?

What will I do , think'st thou ?

Why , go to bed , and sleep .

I will incontinently drown myself .

Well , if thou dost , I shall never love thee after . Why , thou silly gentleman !

It is silliness to live when to live is torment ; and then have we a prescription to die when death is our physician .

O , villanous ; I have looked upon the world for four times seven years , and since I could distinguish betwixt a benefit and an injury , I never found man that knew how to love himself . Ere I would say , I would drown myself for the love of a guinea-hen , I would change my humanity with a baboon .

What should I do ? I confess it is my shame to be so fond ; but it is not in my virtue to amend it .

Virtue , a fig , 'tis in ourselves that we are thus , or thus . Our bodies are our gardens , to the which our wills are gardeners ; so that if we will plant nettles or sow lettuce , set hyssop and woed up thyme , supply it with one gender of herbs or distract it with many , either to have it sterile with idleness or manured with industry , why , the power and corrigible authority of this lies in our wills . If the balance of our lives had not one scale of reason to poise another of sensuality , the blood and baseness of our natures would conduct us to most preposterous conclusions ; but we have reason to cool our raging motions , our carnal stings , our unbitted lusts , whereof I take this that you call love to be a sect or scion .

It cannot be .

It is merely a lust of the blood and a permission of the will . Come , be a man . Drown thyself , drown cats and blind puppies . I have professed me thy friend , and I confess me knit to thy deserving with cables of perdurable toughness ; I could never better stead thee than now . Put money in thy purse ; follow these wars ; defeat thy favour with a usurped beard ; I say , put money in thy purse . It cannot be that Desdemona should long continue her love to the Moor ,put money in thy purse ,nor he his to her . It was a violent commencement in her , and thou shalt see an answerable sequestration ; put but money in thy purse . These Moors are changeable in their wills ;fill thy purse with money :the food that to him now is as luscious as locusts , shall be to him shortly as bitter as coloquintida . She must change for youth : when she is sated with his body , she will find the error of her choice . She must have change , she must : therefore put money in thy purse . If thou wilt needs damn thyself , do it a more delicate way than drowning . Make all the money thou canst . If sanctimony and a frail vow betwixt an erring barbarian and a supersubtle Venetian be not too hard for my wits and all the tribe of hell , thou shalt enjoy her ; therefore make money . A pox of drowning thyself , it is clean out of the way : seek thou rather to be hanged in compassing thy joy than to be drowned and go without her .

Wilt thou be fast to my hopes , if I depend on the issue ?

Thou art sure of me : go , make money . I have told thee often , and I re-tell thee again and again , I hate the Moor : my cause is hearted : thine hath no less reason . Let us be conjunctive in our revenge against him ; if thou canst cuckold him , thou dost thyself a pleasure , me a sport . There are many events in the womb of time which will be delivered . Traverse ; go : provide thy money . We will have more of this to-morrow . Adieu .

Where shall we meet i' the morning ?

At my lodging .

I'll be with thee betimes .

Go to ; farewell . Do you hear , Roderigo ?

What say you ?

No more of drowning , do you hear ?

I am changed . I'll sell all my land .

Go to ; farewell , put money enough in your purse .

Thus do I ever make my fool my purse ;
For I mine own gain'd knowledge should profane ,
If I would time expend with such a snipe 
But for my sport and profit . I hate the Moor ,
And it is thought abroad that 'twixt my sheets 
He has done my office : I know not if 't be true ,
But I , for mere suspicion in that kind ,
Will do as if for surety . He holds me well ;
The better shall my purpose work on him .
Cassio's a proper man ; let me see now :
To get his place ; and to plume up my will 
In double knavery ; how , how ? Let's see :
After some time to abuse Othello's ear 
That he is too familiar with his wife :
He hath a person and a smooth dispose 
To be suspected ; framed to make women false .
The Moor is of a free and open nature ,
That thinks men honest that but seem to be so ,
And will as tenderly be led by the nose 
As asses are .
I have 't ; it is engender'd : hell and night 
Must bring this monstrous birth to the world's light .

What from the cape can you discern at sea ?

Nothing at all : it is a high-wrought flood ;
I cannot 'twixt the heaven and the main 
Descry a sail .

Methinks the wind hath spoke aloud at land ;
A fuller blast ne'er shook our battlements ;
If it hath ruffian'd so upon the sea ,
What ribs of oak , when mountains melt on them ,
Can hold the mortise ? what shall we hear of this ?

A segregation of the Turkish fleet ;
For do but stand upon the foaming shore ,
The chidden billow seems to pelt the clouds ;
The wind-shak'd surge , with high and monstrous mane ,
Seems to cast water on the burning bear 
And quench the guards of the ever-fixed pole :
I never did like molestation view 
On the enchafed flood .

If that the Turkish fleet 
Be not enshelter'd and embay'd , they are drown'd ;
It is impossible they bear it out .


News , lads , our wars are done .
The desperate tempest hath so bang'd the Turks 
That their designment halts ; a noble ship of Venice 
Hath seen a grievous wrack and sufferance 
On most part of their fleet .

How , is this true ?

The ship is here put in ,
A Veronesa ; Michael Cassio ,
Lieutenant to the war-like Moor Othello ,
Is come on shore : the Moor himself's at sea ,
And is in full commission here for Cyprus .

I am glad on 't ; 'tis a worthy governor .

But this same Cassio , though he speak of comfort 
Touching the Turkish loss , yet he looks sadly 
And prays the Moor be safe ; for they were parted 
With foul and violent tempest .

Pray heaven he be ;
For I have serv'd him , and the man commands 
Like a full soldier . Let's to the sea-side , ho !
As well to see the vessel that's come in 
As to throw out our eyes for brave Othello ,
Even till we make the main and the aerial blue 
An indistinct regard .

Come , let's do so ;
For every minute is expectancy 
Of more arrivance .


Thanks , you the valiant of this war-like isle ,
That so approve the Moor . O , let the heavens 
Give him defence against the elements ,
For I have lost him on a dangerous sea .

Is he well shipp'd ?

His bark is stoutly timber'd , and his pilot 
Of very expert and approv'd allowance ;
Therefore my hopes , not surfeited to death ,
Stand in bold cure .

What noise ?

The town is empty ; on the brow o' the sea 
Stand ranks of people , and they cry , 'A sail !' 

My hopes do shape him for the governor .


They do discharge their shot of courtesy ;
Our friends at least .

I pray you , sir , go forth ,
And give us truth who 'tis that is arriv'd .

I shall .


But , good lieutenant , is your general wiv'd ?

Most fortunately : he hath achiev'd a maid 
That paragons description and wild fame ;
One that excels the quirks of blazoning pens ,
And in th' essential vesture of creation 
Does tire the ingener .

How now , who has put in ?

'Tis one Iago , ancient to the general .

He has had most favourable and happy speed :
Tempests themselves , high seas , and howling winds ,
The gutter'd rocks , and congregated sands ,
Traitors ensteep'd to clog the guiltless keel ,
As having sense of beauty , do omit 
Their mortal natures , letting go safely by 
The divine Desdemona .

What is she ?

She that I spake of , our great captain's captain ,
Left in the conduct of the bold Iago ,
Whose footing here anticipates our thoughts 
A se'nnight's speed . Great Jove , Othello guard ,
And swell his sail with thine own powerful breath ,
That he may bless this bay with his tall ship ,
Make love's quick pants in Desdemona's arms ,
Give renew'd fire to our extinc'ed spirits ,
And bring all Cyprus comfort !


O , behold ,
The riches of the ship is come on shore .
Ye men of Cyprus , let her have your knees .
Hail to thee , lady , and the grace of heaven ,
Before , behind thee , and on every hand ,

Enwheel thee round !

I thank you , valiant Cassio .
What tidings can you tell me of my lord ?

He is not yet arriv'd ; nor know I aught 
But that he's well , and will be shortly here .

O , but I fear How lost you company ?

The great contention of the sea and skies 
Parted our fellowship . But hark , a sail .


They give their greeting to the citadel :
This likewise is a friend .

See for the news !

Good ancient , you are welcome :

welcome , mistress .
Let it not gall your patience , good Iago ,
That I extend my manners ; 'tis my breeding 
That gives me this bold show of courtesy .


Sir , would she give you so much of her lips 
As of her tongue she oft bestows on me ,
You'd have enough .

Alas , she has no speech .

In faith , too much ;
I find it still when I have list to sleep :
Marry , before your ladyship , I grant ,
She puts her tongue a little in her heart ,
And chides with thinking .

You have little cause to say so .

Come on , come on ; you are pictures out of doors ,
Bells in your parlours , wild cats in your kitchens ,
Saints in your injuries , devils being offended ,
Players in your housewifery , and housewives in your beds .

O , fie upon thee , slanderer .

Nay , it is true , or else I am a Turk :
You rise to play and go to bed to work .

You shall not write my praise .

No , let me not .

What wouldst thou write of me , if thou shouldst praise me ?

O gentle lady , do not put me to 't ,
For I am nothing if not critical .

Come on ; assay . There's one gone to the harbour ?

Ay , madam .

I am not merry , but I do beguile 
The thing I am by seeming otherwise .
Come , how wouldst thou praise me ?

I am about it ; but indeed my invention 
Comes from my pate as birdlime does from frize ;
It plucks out brains and all : but my muse labours ,
And thus she is deliver'd .
If she be fair and wise , fairness and wit ,
The one's for use , the other useth it .

Well prais'd , How if she be black and witty ?

If she be black , and thereto have a wit ,
She'll find a white that shall her blackness fit .

Worse and worse .

How if fair and foolish ?

She never yet was foolish that was fair ,
For even her folly help'd her to an heir .

These are old fond paradoxes to make fools laugh i' the alehouse . What miserable praise hast thou for her that's foul and foolish ?

There's none so foul and foolish thereunto 
But does foul pranks which fair and wise ones do .

O heavy ignorance , thou praisest the worst best . But what praise couldst thou bestow on a deserving woman indeed , one that , in the authority of her merit , did justly put on the vouch of very malice itself ?

She that was ever fair and never proud ,
Had tongue at will and yet was never loud ,
Never lack'd gold and yet went never gay ,
Fled from her wish and yet said 'Now I may ,' 
She that being anger'd , her revenge being nigh ,
Bade her wrong stay and her displeasure fly ,
She that in wisdom never was so frail 
To change the cod's head for the salmon's tail ,
She that could think and ne'er disclose her mind ,
See suitors following and not look behind ,
She was a wight , if ever such wight were ,

To do what ?

To suckle fools and chronicle small beer .

O most lame and impotent conclusion , Do not learn of him , Emilia , though he be thy husband . How say you , Cassio ? is he not a most profane and liberal counsellor ?

He speaks home , madam ; you may relish him more in the soldier than in the scholar .

He takes her by the palm ; ay , well said , whisper ; with as little a web as this will I ensnare as great a fly as Cassio . Ay , smile upon her , do ; I will gyve thee in thine own courtship . You say true , 'tis so , indeed . If such tricks as these strip you out of your lieutenantry , it had been better you had not kissed your three fingers so oft , which now again you are most apt to play the sir in . Very good ; well kissed , an excellent courtesy , 'tis so , indeed . Yet again your fingers to your lips ? would they were clyster-pipes for your sake , [A trumpet heard .] The Moor , I know his trumpet .

'Tis truly so .

Let's meet him and receive him .

Lo , where he comes .


O my fair warrior !

My dear Othello !

It gives me wonder great as my content 
To see you here before me . O my soul's joy !
If after every tempest come such calms ,
May the winds blow till they have waken'd death !
And let the labouring bark climb hills of seas 
Olympus-high , and duck again as low 
As hell's from heaven , If it were now to die ,
'Twere now to be most happy , for I fear 
My soul hath her content so absolute 
That not another comfort like to this 
Succeeds in unknown fate .

The heavens forbid 
But that our loves and comforts should increase 
Even as our days do grow !

Amen to that , sweet powers !
I cannot speak enough of this content ;
It stops me here ; it is too much of joy :
And this , and this , the greatest discords be ,

That e'er our hearts shall make !

O , you are well tun'd now ,
But I'll set down the pegs that make this music ,
As honest as I am .

Come , let us to the castle .
News , friends ; our wars are done , the Turks are drown'd .
How does my old acquaintance of this isle ?
Honey , you shall be well desir'd in Cyprus ;
I have found great love amongst them . O my sweet ,
I prattle out of fashion , and I dote 
In mine own comforts . I prithee , good Iago ,
Go to the bay and disembark my coffers .
Bring thou the master to the citadel ;
He is a good one , and his worthiness 
Does challenge much respect . Come , Desdemona ,
Once more well met at Cyprus .


Do thou meet me presently at the harbour . Come hither . If thou be'st valiant , as they say base men being in love have then a nobility in their natures more than is native to them , list me . The lieutenant to-night watches on the court of guard : first , I must tell thee this , Desdemona is directly in love with him .

With him , why , 'tis not possible .

Lay thy finger thus , and let thy soul be instructed . Mark me with what violence she first loved the Moor but for bragging and telling her fantastical lies ; and will she love him still for prating ? let not thy discreet heart think it . Her eye must be fed ; and what delight shall she have to look on the devil ? When the blood is made dull with the act of sport , there should be , again to inflame it , and to give satiety a fresh appetite , loveliness in favour , sympathy in years , manners , and beauties ; all which the Moor is defective in . Now , for want of these required conveniences , her delicate tenderness will find itself abused , begin to heave the gorge , disrelish and abhor the Moor ; very nature will instruct her in it , and compel her to some second choice . Now , sir , this granted , as it is a most pregnant and unforced position , who stands so eminently in the degree of this fortune as Cassio does ? a knave very voluble , no further conscionable than in putting on the mere form of civil and humane seeming , for the better compassing of his salt and most hidden loose affection ? why , none ; why , none : a slipper and subtle knave , a finder-out of occasions , that has an eye can stamp and counterfeit advantages , though true advantage never present itself ; a devilish knave , Besides , the knave is handsome , young , and hath all those requisites in him that folly and green minds look after ; a pestilent complete knave , and the woman hath found him already .

I cannot believe that in her ; she is full of most blessed condition .

Blessed fig's end , the wine she drinks is made of grapes ; if she had been blessed she would never have loved the Moor ; blessed pudding , Didst thou not see her paddle with the palm of his hand ? didst not mark that ?

Yes , that I did ; but that was but courtesy .

Lechery , by this hand , an index and obscure prologue to the history of lust and foul thoughts . They met so near with their lips , that their breaths embraced together . Villanous thoughts , Roderigo , when these mutualities so marshal the way , hard at hand comes the master and main exercise , the incorporate conclusion . Pish , But , sir , be you ruled by me : I have brought you from Venice . Watch you to-night ; for the command , I'll lay 't upon you : Cassio knows you not . I'll not be far from you : do you find some occasion to anger Cassio , either by speaking too loud , or tainting his discipline ; or from what other course you please , which the time shall more favourably minister .

Well .

Sir , he is rash and very sudden in choler , and haply may strike at you : provoke him , that he may ; for even out of that will I cause these of Cyprus to mutiny , whose qualification shall come into no true taste again but by the displanting of Cassio . So shall you have a shorter journey to your desires by the means I shall then have to prefer them ; and the impediment most profitably removed , without the which there were no expectation of our prosperity .

I will do this , if I can bring it to any opportunity .

I warrant thee . Meet me by and by at the citadel : I must fetch his necessaries ashore .
Farewell .

Adieu .


That Cassio loves her , I do well believe it ;
That she loves him , 'tis apt , and of great credit :
The Moor , howbeit that I endure him not ,
Is of a constant , loving , noble nature ;
And I dare think he'll prove to Desdemona 
A most dear husband . Now , I do love her too ;
Not out of absolute lust ,though peradventure 
I stand accountant for as great a sin ,
But partly led to diet my revenge ,
For that I do suspect the lusty Moor 
Hath leap'd into my seat ; the thought whereof 
Doth like a poisonous mineral gnaw my inwards ;
And nothing can or shall content my soul 
Till I am even'd with him , wife for wife ;
Or failing so , yet that I put the Moor 
At least into a jealousy so strong 
That judgment cannot cure . Which thing to do ,
If this poor trash of Venice , whom I trash 
For his quick hunting , stand the putting on ,
I'll have our Michael Cassio on the hip ;
Abuse him to the Moor in the rank garb ,
For I fear Cassio with my night-cap too ,
Make the Moor thank me , love me , and reward me 
For making him egregiously an ass 
And practising upon his peace and quiet 
Even to madness . 'Tis here , but yet confus'd :
Knavery's plain face is never seen till us'd .


It is Othello's pleasure , our noble and valiant general , that , upon certain tidings now arrived , importing the mere perdition of the Turkish fleet , every man put himself into triumph ; some to dance , some to make bonfires , each man to what sport and revels his addiction leads him ; for , besides these beneficial news , it is the celebration of his nuptial . So much was his pleasure should be proclaimed . All offices are open , and there is full liberty of feasting from this present hour of five till the bell have told eleven . Heaven bless the isle of Cyprus and our noble general Othello !


Good Michael , look you to the guard to-night :
Let's teach ourselves that honourable stop ,
Not to outsport discretion .

Iago hath direction what to do ;
But , notwithstanding , with my personal eye 
Will I look to 't .

Iago is most honest .
Michael , good night ; to-morrow with your earliest 
Let me have speech with you .

Come , my dear love ,
The purchase made , the fruits are to ensue ;
That profit's yet to come 'twixt me and you .
Good night .

Welcome , Iago ; we must to the watch .

Not this hour , lieutenant ; 'tis not yet ten o' the clock . Our general cast us thus early for the love of his Desdemona , who let us not therefore blame ; he hath not yet made wanton the night with her , and she is sport for Jove .

She's a most exquisite lady .

And , I'll warrant her , full of game .

Indeed , she is a most fresh and delicate creature .

What an eye she has , methinks it sounds a parley of provocation .

An inviting eye ; and yet methinks right modest .

And when she speaks , is it not an alarum to love ?

She is indeed perfection .

Well , happiness to their sheets , Come , lieutenant , I have a stoup of wine , and here without are a brace of Cyprus gallants that would fain have a measure to the health of black Othello .

Not to-night , good Iago : I have very poor and unhappy brains for drinking : I could well wish courtesy would invent some other custom of entertainment .

O , they are our friends ; but one cup : I'll drink for you .

I have drunk but one cup to-night , and that was craftily qualified too , and , behold , what innovation it makes here : I am unfortunate in the infirmity , and dare not task my weakness with any more .

What , man , 'tis a night of revels ; the gallants desire it .

Where are they ?

Here at the door ; I pray you , call them in .

I'll do 't ; but it dislikes me .


If I can fasten but one cup upon him ,
With that which he hath drunk to-night already ,
He'll be as full of quarrel and offence 
As my young mistress' dog . Now , my sick fool Roderigo ,
Whom love has turn'd almost the wrong side out ,
To Desdemona hath to-night carous'd 
Potations pottle deep ; and he's to watch .
Three lads of Cyprus , noble swelling spirits ,
That hold their honours in a wary distance ,
The very elements of this war-like isle ,
Have I to-night fluster'd with flowing cups ,
And they watch too . Now , 'mongst this flock of drunkards ,
Am I to put our Cassio in some action 
That may offend the isle . But here they come .
If consequence do but approve my dream ,
My boat sails freely , both with wind and stream .


'Fore God , they have given me a rouse already .

Good faith , a little one ; not past a pint , as I am a soldier .

Some wine , ho !

And let me the canakin clink , clink ;
And let me the canakin clink :
A soldier's a man ;
A life's but a span ;
Why then let a soldier drink .

Some wine , boys !

'Fore God , an excellent song .

I learned it in England , where indeed they are most potent in potting ; your Dane , your German , and your swag-bellied Hollander ,  drink , ho !are nothing to your English .

Is your Englishman so expert in his drinking ?

Why , he drinks you with facility your Dane dead drunk ; he sweats not to overthrow your Almain ; he gives your Hollander a vomit ere the next pottle can be filled .

To the health of our general !

I am for it , lieutenant ; and I'll do you justice .

O sweet England !

King Stephen was a worthy peer ,
His breeches cost him but a crown ;
He held them sixpence all too dear ,
With that he call'd the tailor lown .
He was a wight of high renown ,
And thou art but of low degree :
'Tis pride that pulls the country down ,
Then take thine auld cloak about thee .

Some wine , ho !

Why , this is a more exquisite song than the other .

Will you hear 't again ?

No ; for I hold him to be unworthy of his place that does those things . Well , God's above all ; and there be souls must be saved , and there be souls must not be saved .

It's true , good lieutenant .

For mine own part ,no offence to the general , nor any man of quality ,I hope to be saved .

And so do I too , lieutenant .

Ay ; but , by your leave , not before me ; the lieutenant is to be saved before the ancient . Let's have no more of this ; let's to our affairs . God forgive us our sins , Gentlemen , let's look to our business . Do not think , gentlemen , I am drunk : this is my ancient ; this is my right hand , and this is my left hand . I am not drunk now ; I can stand well enough , and speak well enough .

Excellent well .

Why , very well , then ; you must not think then that I am drunk .


To the platform , masters ; come , let's set the watch .

You see this fellow that is gone before ;
He is a soldier fit to stand by C sar 
And give direction ; and do but see his vice ;
'Tis to his virtue a just equinox ,
The one as long as the other ; 'tis pity of him .
I fear the trust Othello puts him in ,
On some odd time of his infirmity ,
Will shake this island .

But is he often thus ?

'Tis evermore the prologue to his sleep :
He'll watch the horologe a double set ,
If drink rock not his cradle .

It were well 
The general were put in mind of it .
Perhaps he sees it not ; or his good nature 
Prizes the virtue that appears in Cassio ,
And looks not on his evils . Is not this true ?


How now , Roderigo !
I pray you , after the lieutenant ; go .


And 'tis great pity that the noble Moor 
Should hazard such a place as his own second 
With one of an ingraft infirmity ;
It were an honest action to say 
So to the Moor .

Not I , for this fair island :
I do love Cassio well , and would do much 
To cure him of this evil . But hark , what noise ?

You rogue , you rascal !

What's the matter , lieutenant ?

A knave teach me my duty !
I'll beat the knave into a twiggen bottle .

Beat me !

Dost thou prate , rogue ?


Nay , good lieutenant ;
I pray you , sir , hold your hand .

Let me go , sir ,
Or I'll knock you o'er the mazzard .

Come , come ; you're drunk .

Drunk !


Away , I say , go out , and cry a mutiny .

Nay , good lieutenant , God's will , gentlemen !
Help , ho , Lieutenant , sir , Montano , sir !
Help , masters , Here's a goodly watch indeed !

Who's that that rings the bell ? Diablo , ho !
The town will rise : God's will , lieutenant , hold !
You will be sham'd for ever .


What is the matter here ?

'Zounds , I bleed still ; I am hurt to the death .

Hold , for your lives !

Hold , ho , lieutenant , Sir , Montano , gentlemen !
Have you forgot all sense of place and duty ?
Hold , the general speaks to you ; hold for shame !

Why , how now , ho , from whence ariseth this ?
Are we turn'd Turks , and to ourselves do that 
Which heaven hath forbid the Ottomites ?
For Christian shame put by this barbarous brawl ;
He that stirs next to carve for his own rage 
Holds his soul light ; he dies upon his motion .
Silence that dreadful bell , it frights the isle 
From her propriety . What is the matter , masters ?
Honest Iago , that look'st dead with grieving ,
Speak , who began this ? on thy love , I charge thee .

I do not know ; friends all but now , even now ,
In quarter and in terms like bride and groom 
Devesting them for bed ; and then , but now ,
As if some planet had unwitted men ,
Swords out , and tilting one at other's breast ,
In opposition bloody . I cannot speak 
Any beginning to this peevish odds ,
And would in action glorious I had lost 
Those legs that brought me to a part of it !

How comes it , Michael , you are thus forgot ?

I pray you , pardon me ; I cannot speak .

Worthy Montano , you were wont be civil ;
The gravity and stillness of your youth 
The world hath noted , and your name is great 
In mouths of wisest censure : what's the matter ,
That you unlace your reputation thus 
And spend your rich opinion for the name 
Of a night-brawler ? give me answer to it .

Worthy Othello , I am hurt to danger ;
Your officer , Iago , can inform you ,
While I spare speech , which something now offends me ,
Of all that I do know ; nor know I aught 
By me that's said or done amiss this night ,
Unless self-charity be sometimes a vice ,
And to defend ourselves it be a sin 
When violence assails us .

Now , by heaven ,
My blood begins my safer guides to rule ,
And passion , having my best judgment collied ,
Assays to lead the way . If I once stir ,
Or do but lift this arm , the best of you 
Shall sink in my rebuke . Give me to know 
How this foul rout began , who set it on ;
And he that is approv'd in this offence ,
Though he had twinn'd with me both at a birth 
Shall lose me . What , in a town of war ,
Yet wild , the people's hearts brimful of fear ,
To manage private and domestic quarrel ,
In night , and on the court and guard of safety !
'Tis monstrous . Iago , who began 't ?

If partially affin'd , or leagu'd in office ,
Thou dost deliver more or less than truth ,
Thou art no soldier .

Touch me not so near ;
I had rather have this tongue cut from my mouth 
Than it should do offence to Michael Cassio ;
Yet , I persuade myself , to speak the truth 
Shall nothing wrong him . Thus it is , general .
Montano and myself being in speech ,
There comes a fellow crying out for he'p ,
And Cassio following with determin'd sword 
To execute upon him . Sir , this gentleman 
Steps in to Cassio , and entreats his pause ;
Myself the crying fellow did pursue ,
Lest by his clamour , as it so fell out ,
The town might fall in fright ; he , swift of foot ,
Outran my purpose , and I return'd the rather 
For that I heard the clink and fall of swords ,
And Cassio high in oath , which till to-night 
I ne'er might say before . When I came back ,
For this was brief ,I found them close together ,
At blow and thrust , even as again they were 
When you yourself did part them .
More of this matter can I not report :
But men are men ; the best sometimes forget :
Though Cassio did some little wrong to him ,
As men in rage strike those that wish them best ,
Yet , surely Cassio , I believe , receiv'd 
From him that fled some strange indignity ,
Which patience could not pass .

I know , Iago ,
Thy honesty and love doth mince this matter ,
Making it light to Cassio . Cassio , I love thee ;
But never more be officer of mine .


Look , if my gentle love be not rais'd up ;

I'll make thee an example .

What's the matter ?

All's well now , sweeting ; come away to bed .
Sir , for your hurts , myself will be your surgeon .
Lead him off .

Iago , look with care about the town ,
And silence those whom this vile brawl distracted .
Come , Desdemona ; 'tis the soldiers' life ,
To have their balmy slumbers wak'd with strife .


What , are you hurt , lieutenant ?

Ay ; past all surgery .

Marry , heaven forbid !

Reputation , reputation , reputation , O , I have lost my reputation . I have lost the immortal part of myself , and what remains is bestial . My reputation , Iago , my reputation !

As I am an honest man , I thought you had received some bodily wound ; there is more offence in that than in reputation . Reputation is an idle and most false imposition ; oft got without merit , and lost without deserving : you have lost no reputation at all , unless you repute yourself such a loser . What , man ; there are ways to recover the general again ; you are but now cast in his mood , a punishment more in policy than in malice ; even so as one would beat his offenceless dog to affright an imperious lion . Sue to him again , and he is yours .

I will rather sue to be despised than to deceive so good a commander with so slight , so drunken , and so indiscreet an officer . Drunk , and speak parrot , and squabble , swagger , swear , and discourse fustian with one's own shadow , O thou invisible spirit of wine , if thou hast no name to be known by , let us call thee devil !

What was he that you followed with your sword ? What had he done to you ?

I know not .

Is 't possible ?

I remember a mass of things , but nothing distinctly ; a quarrel , but nothing wherefore . O God , that men should put an enemy in their mouths to steal away their brains ; that we should , with joy , pleasance , revel , and applause , transform ourselves into beasts .

Why , but you are now well enough ; how came you thus recovered ?

It hath pleased the devil drunkenness to give place to the devil wrath ; one unperfectness shows me another , to make me frankly despise myself .

Come , you are too severe a moraler . As the time , the place , and the condition of this country stands , I could heartily wish this had not befallen , but since it is as it is , mend it for your own good .

I will ask him for my place again ; he shall tell me I am a drunkard , Had I as many mouths as Hydra , such an answer would stop them all . To be now a sensible man , by and by a fool , and presently a beast , O strange , Every inordinate cup is unblessed and the ingredient is a devil .

Come , come ; good wine is a good familiar creature if it be well used ; exclaim no more against it . And , good lieutenant , I think you think I love you .

I have well approved it , sir . I drunk !

You or any man living may be drunk at some time , man . I'll tell you what you shall do . Our general's wife is now the general : I may say so in this respect , for that he hath devoted and given up himself to the contemplation , mark , and denotement of her parts and graces : confess yourself freely to her ; importune her ; she'll help to put you in your place again . She is of so free , so kind , so apt , so blessed a disposition , that she holds it a vice in her goodness not to do more than she is requested . This broken joint between you and her husband entreat her to splinter ; and my fortunes against any lay worth naming , this crack of your love shall grow stronger than it was before .

You advise me well .

I protest , in the sincerity of love and honest kindness .

I think it freely ; and betimes in the morning I will beseech the virtuous Desdemona to undertake for me . I am desperate of my fortunes if they check me here .

You are in the right . Good night , lieutenant ; I must to the watch .

Good night , honest Iago !


And what's he then that says I play the villain ?
When this advice is free I give and honest ,
Probal to thinking and indeed the course 
To win the Moor again ? For 'tis most easy 
The inclining Desdemona to subdue 
In any honest suit ; she's fram'd as fruitful 
As the free elements . And then for her 
To win the Moor , were 't to renounce his baptism ,
All seals and symbols of redeemed sin ,
His soul is so enfetter'd to her love ,
That she may make , unmake , do what she list ,
Even as her appetite shall play the god 
With his weak function . How am I then a villain 
To counsel Cassio to this parallel course ,
Directly to his good ? Divinity of hell !
When devils will the blackest sins put on ,
They do suggest at first with heavenly shows ,
As I do now ; for while this honest fool 
Plies Desdemona to repair his fortunes ,
And she for him pleads strongly to the Moor ,
I'll pour this pestilence into his ear 
That she repeals him for her body's lust ;
And , by how much she strives to do him good ,
She shall undo her credit with the Moor .
So will I turn her virtue into pitch ,
And out of her own goodness make the net 
That shall enmesh them all .

How now , Roderigo !

I do follow here in the chase , not like a hound that hunts , but one that fills up the cry . My money is almost spent ; I have been to-night exceedingly well cudgelled ; and I think the issue will be , I shall have so much experience for my pains ; and so , with no money at all and a little more wit , return again to Venice .

How poor are they that have not patience !
What wound did ever heal but by degrees ?
Thou know'st we work by wit and not by witchcraft ,
And wit depends on dilatory time .
Does 't not go well ? Cassio hath beaten thee ,
And thou by that small hurt hast cashiered Cassio .
Though other things grow fair against the sun ,
Yet fruits that blossom first will first be ripe :
Content thyself awhile . By the mass , 'tis morning ;
Pleasure and action make the hours seem short .
Retire thee ; go where thou art billeted :
Away , I say ; thou shalt know more hereafter :
Nay , get thee gone .

Two things are to be done ,
My wife must move for Cassio to her mistress ;
I'll set her on ;
Myself the while to draw the Moor apart ,
And bring him jump when he may Cassio find 
Soliciting his wife : ay , that's the way :
Dull not device by coldness and delay .

Masters , play here , I will content your pains ;
Something that's brief ; and bid 'Good morrow , general .' 

Why , masters , have your instruments been in Naples , that they speak i' the nose thus ?

How , sir , how ?

Are these , I pray you , wind-instruments ?

Ay , marry , are they , sir .

O , thereby hangs a tail .

Whereby hangs a tale , sir ?

Marry , sir , by many a wind-instrument that I know . But , masters , here's money for you ; and the general so likes your music , that he desires you , for love's sake , to make no more noise with it .

Well , sir , we will not .

If you have any music that may not be heard , to 't again ; but , as they say , to hear music the general does not greatly care .

We have none such , sir .

Then put up your pipes in your bag , for 
I'll away . Go ; vanish into air ; away !


Dost thou hear , mine honest friend ?

No , I hear not your honest friend ; I hear you .

Prithee , keep up thy quillets . There's a poor piece of gold for thee . If the gentlewoman that attends the general's wife be stirring , tell her there's one Cassio entreats her a little favour of speech : wilt thou do this ?

She is stirring , sir : if she will stir hither ,
I shall seem to notify unto her .

Do , good my friend .


In happy time , Iago .

You have not been a-bed , then ?

Why , no ; the day had broke 
Before we parted . I have made bold , Iago ,
To send in to your wife ; my suit to her 
Is , that she will to virtuous Desdemona 
Procure me some access .

I'll send her to you presently ;
And I'll devise a mean to draw the Moor 
Out of the way , that your converse and business 
May be more free .

I humbly thank you for 't .

I never knew 
A Florentine more kind and honest .


Good morrow , good lieutenant : I am sorry 
For your displeasure ; but all will soon be well .
The general and his wife are talking of it ,
And she speaks for you stoutly : the Moor replies 
That he you hurt is of great fame in Cyprus 
And great affinity , and that in wholesome wisdom 
He might not but refuse you ; but he protests he loves you ,
And needs no other suitor but his likings 
To take the saf'st occasion by the front 
To bring you in again .

Yet , I beseech you ,
If you think fit , or that it may be done ,
Give me advantage of some brief discourse 
With Desdemona alone .

Pray you , come in :
I will bestow you where you shall have time 
To speak your bosom freely .

I am much bound to you .


These letters give , Iago , to the pilot ,
And by him do my duties to the senate ;
That done , I will be walking on the works ;
Repair there to me .

Well , my good lord , I'll do t .

This fortification , gentlemen , shall we see 't ?

We'll wait upon your lordship .


Be thou assur'd , good Cassio , I will do 
All my abilities in thy behalf .

Good madam , do : I warrant it grieves my husband ,
As if the case were his .

O , that's an honest fellow . Do not doubt , Cassio ,
But I will have my lord and you again 
As friendly as you were .

Bounteous madam ,
Whatever shall become of Michael Cassio ,
He's never anything but your true servant .

I know 't ; I thank you . You do love my lord ;
You have known him long ; and be you well assur'd 
He shall in strangeness stand no further off 
Than in a politic distance .

Ay , but , lady ,
That policy may either last so long ,
Or feed upon such nice and waterish diet ,
Or breed itself so out of circumstance ,
That , I being absent and my place supplied ,
My general will forget my love and service .

Do not doubt that ; before Emilia here 
I give thee warrant of thy place . Assure thee ,
If I do vow a friendship , I'll perform it 
To the last article ; my lord shall never rest ;
I'll watch him tame , and talk him out of patience ;
His bed shall seem a school , his board a shrift ;
I'll intermingle every thing he does 
With Cassio's suit . Therefore be merry , Cassio ;
For thy solicitor shall rather die 
Than give thy cause away .


Madam , here comes my lord .

Madam , I'll take my leave .

Why , stay , and hear me speak .

Madam , not now ; I am very ill at ease ,
Unfit for mine own purposes .

Well , do your discretion .


Ha , I like not that .

What dost thou say ?

Nothing , my lord : or if I know not what .

Was not that Cassio parted from my wife ?

Cassio , my lord ? No , sure , I cannot think it 
That he would steal away so guilty-like ,
Seeing you coming .

I do believe 'twas he .

How now , my lord !
I have been talking with a suitor here ,
A man that languishes in your displeasure .

Who is 't you mean ?

Why , your lieutenant , Cassio . Good my lord ,
If I have any grace or power to move you ,
His present reconciliation take ;
For if he be not one that truly loves you ,
That errs in ignorance and not in cunning ,
I have no judgment in an honest face .
I prithee call him back .

Went he hence now ?

Ay , sooth ; so humbled ,
That he hath left part of his grief with me ,
To suffer with him . Good love , call him back .

Not now , sweet Desdemona ; some other time .

But shall 't be shortly ?

The sooner , sweet , for you .

Shall 't be to-night at supper ?

No , not to-night .

To-morrow dinner then ?

I shall not dine at home ;
I meet the captains at the citadel .

Why then , to-morrow night ; or Tuesday morn ;
On Tuesday noon , or night ; on Wednesday morn :
I prithee name the time , but let it not 
Exceed three days : in faith , he's penitent ;
And yet his trespass , in our common reason ,
Save that they say , the wars must make examples 
Out of their best ,is not almost a fault 
To incur a private check . When shall he come ?
Tell me , Othello : I wonder in my soul ,
What you could ask me that I should deny ,
Or stand so mammering on . What , Michael Cassio ,
That came a wooing with you , and so many a time ,
When I have spoke of you dispraisingly ,
Hath ta'en your part ; to have so much to do 
To bring him in , Trust me , I could do much .

Prithee , no more ; let him come when he will ;
I will deny thee nothing .

Why , this is not a boon ;
'Tis as I should entreat you wear your gloves ,
Or feed on nourishing dishes , or keep you warm ,
Or sue to you to do a peculiar profit 
To your own person ; nay , when I have a suit 
Wherein I mean to touch your love indeed ,
It shall be full of poise and difficult weight ,
And fearful to be granted .

I will deny thee nothing :
Whereon , I do beseech thee , grant me this ,
To leave me but a little to myself .

Shall I deny you ? no : farewell , my lord .

Farewell , my Desdemona : I'll come to thee straight .

Emilia , come . Be as your fancies teach you ;
Whate'er you be , I am obedient .


Excellent wretch , Perdition catch my soul 
But I do love thee , and when I love thee not ,
Chaos is come again .

My noble lord ,

What dost thou say , Iago ?

Did Michael Cassio , when you woo'd my lady ,
Know of your love ?

He did , from first to last : why dost thou ask ?

But for a satisfaction of my thought ;
No further harm .

Why of thy thought , Iago ?

I did not think he had been acquainted with her .

O , yes ; and went between us very oft .

Indeed !

Indeed , ay , indeed ; discern'st thou aught in that ?
Is he not honest ?

Honest , my lord ?

Honest , ay , honest .

My lord , for aught I know .

What dost thou think ?

Think , my lord !

Think , my lord !
By heaven , he echoes me ,
As if there were some monster in his thought 
Too hideous to be shown . Thou dost mean something :
I heard thee say but now , thou lik'dst not that ,
When Cassio left my wife ; what didst not like ?
And when I told thee he was of my counsel 
In my whole course of wooing , thou criedst , 'Indeed !' 
And didst contract and purse thy brow together ,
As if thou then hadst shut up in thy brain 
Some horrible conceit . If thou dost love me ,
Show me thy thought .

My lord , you know I love you .

I think thou dost ;
And , for I know thou art full of love and honesty ,
And weigh'st thy words before thou giv'st them breath ,
Therefore these stops of thine fright me the more ;
For such things in a false disloyal knave 
Are tricks of custom , but in a man that's just 
They are close delations , working from the heart 
That passion cannot rule .

For Michael Cassio ,
I dare be sworn I think that he is honest .

I think so too .

Men should be what they seem ;
Or those that be not , would they might seem none !

Certain , men should be what they seem .

Why then , I think Cassio 's an honest man .

Nay , yet there's more in this .
I pray thee , speak to me as to thy thinkings ,
As thou dost ruminate , and give thy worst of thoughts 
The worst of words .

Good my lord , pardon me ;
Though I am bound to every act of duty ,
I am not bound to that all slaves are free to .
Utter my thoughts ? Why , say they are vile and false ;
As where's that palace whereinto foul things 
Sometimes intrude not ? who has a breast so pure 
But some uncleanly apprehensions 
Keep leets and law days , and in session sit 
With meditations lawful ?

Thou dost conspire against thy friend , Iago ,
If thou but think'st him wrong'd , and mak'st his ear 
A stranger to thy thoughts .

I do beseech you ,
Though I perchance am vicious in my guess ,
As , I confess , it is my nature's plague 
To spy into abuses , and oft my jealousy 
Shapes faults that are not ,that your wisdom yet ,
From one that so imperfectly conceits ,
Would take no notice , nor build yourself a trouble 
Out of his scattering and unsure observance .
It were not for your quiet nor your good ,
Nor for my manhood , honesty , or wisdom ,
To let you know my thoughts .

What dost thou mean ?

Good name in man and woman , dear my lord ,
Is the immediate jewel of their souls :
Who steals my purse steals trash ; 'tis something , nothing ;
'Twas mine , 'tis his , and has been slave to thousands ;
But he that filches from me my good name 
Robs me of that which not enriches him ,
And makes me poor indeed .

By heaven , I'll know thy thoughts .

You cannot , if my heart were in your hand ;
Nor shall not , whilst 'tis in my custody .

Ha !

O , beware , my lord , of jealousy ;
It is the green-ey'd monster which doth mock 
The meat it feeds on ; that cuckold lives in bliss 
Who , certain of his fate , loves not his wronger ;
But , O , what damned minutes tells he o'er 
Who dotes , yet doubts ; suspects , yet soundly loves !

O misery !

Poor and content is rich , and rich enough ,
But riches fineless is as poor as winter 
To him that ever fears he shall be poor .
Good heaven , the souls of all my tribe defend 
From jealousy !

Why , why is this ?
Think'st thou I'd make a life of jealousy ,
To follow still the changes of the moon 
With fresh suspicions ? No ; to be once in doubt 
Is once to be resolved . Exchange me for a goat 
When I shall turn the business of my soul 
To such exsufflicate and blown surmises ,
Matching thy inference . 'Tis not to make me jealous 
To say my wife is fair , feeds well , loves company ,
Is free of speech , sings , plays , and dances well ;
Where virtue is , these are more virtuous :
Nor from mine own weak merits will I draw 
The smallest fear , or doubt of her revolt ;
For she had eyes , and chose me . No , Iago ;
I'll see before I doubt ; when I doubt , prove ;
And , on the proof , there is no more but this ,
Away at once with love or jealousy !

I am glad of it ; for now I shall have reason 
To show the love and duty that I bear you 
With franker spirit ; therefore , as I am bound ,
Receive it from me ; I speak not yet of proof .
Look to your wife ; observe her well with Cassio ;
Wear your eye thus , not jealous nor secure :
I would not have your free and noble nature 
Out of self-bounty be abus'd ; look to 't :
I know our country disposition well ;
In Venice they do let heaven see the pranks 
They dare not show their husbands ; their best conscience 
Is not to leave 't undone , but keep 't unknown .

Dost thou say so ?

She did deceive her father , marrying you :
And when she seem'd to shake and fear your looks ,
She lov'd them most .

And so she did .

Why , go to , then ;
She that so young could give out such a seeming ,
To seel her father's eyes up close as oak ,
He thought 'twas witchcraft ; but I am much to blame ;
I humbly do beseech you of your pardon 
For too much loving you .

I am bound to thee for ever .

I see , this hath a little dash'd your spirits .

Not a jot , not a jot .

I' faith , I fear it has .
I hope you will consider what is spoke 
Comes from my love . But , I do see you're mov'd ;
I am to pray you not to strain my speech 
To grosser issues nor to larger reach 
Than to suspicion .

I will not .

Should you do so , my lord ,
My speech should fall into such vile success 
As my thoughts aim not at . Cassio's my worthy friend 
My lord , I see you're mov'd .

No , not much mov'd :
I do not think but Desdemona's honest .

Long live she so , and long live you to think so !

And , yet , how nature erring from itself ,

Ay , there's the point : as , to be bold with you ,
Not to affect many proposed matches 
Of her own clime , complexion , and degree ,
Whereto , we see , in all things nature tends ;
Foh , one may smell in such , a will most rank ,
Foul disproportion , thoughts unnatural .
But pardon me ; I do not in position 
Distinctly speak of her , though I may fear 
Her will , recoiling to her better judgment ,
May fail to match you with her country forms 
And happily repent .

Farewell , farewell :
If more thou dost perceive , let me know more ;
Set on thy wife to observe . Leave me , Iago .

My lord , I take my leave .


Why did I marry ? This honest creature , doubtless ,
Sees and knows more , much more , than he unfolds .

My lord , I would I might entreat your honour 
To scan this thing no further ; leave it to time .
Although 'tis fit that Cassio have his place ,
For , sure he fills it up with great ability ,
Yet , if you please to hold him off awhile ,
You shall by that perceive him and his means :
Note if your lady strain his entertainment 
With any strong or vehement importunity ;
Much will be seen in that . In the mean time ,
Let me be thought too busy in my fears ,
As worthy cause I have to fear I am ,
And hold her free , I do beseech your honour .

Fear not my government .

I once more take my leave .


This fellow's of exceeding honesty ,
And knows all qualities , with a learned spirit ,
Of human dealings ; if I do prove her haggard ,
Though that her jesses were my dear heartstrings ,
I'd whistle her off and let her down the wind ,
To prey at fortune . Haply , for I am black ,
And have not those soft parts of conversation 
That chamberers have , or , for I am declin'd 
Into the vale of years yet that's not much 
She's gone , I am abus'd ; and my relief 
Must be to loathe her . O curse of marriage !
That we can call these delicate creatures ours ,
And not their appetites . I had rather be a toad ,
And live upon the vapour of a dungeon ,
Than keep a corner in the thing I love 
For others' uses . Yet , 'tis the plague of great ones ;
Prerogativ'd are they less than the base ;
'Tis destiny unshunnable , like death :
Even then this forked plague is fated to us 
When we do quicken .
Look , where she comes .
If she be false , O , then heaven mocks itself .
I'll not believe it .


How now , my dear Othello !
Your dinner and the generous islanders 
By you invited , do attend your presence .

I am to blame .

Why do you speak so faintly ?
Are you not well ?

I have a pain upon my forehead here .

Faith , that's with watching ; 'twill away again :
Let me but bind it hard , within this hour 
It will be well .

Your napkin is too little :

Let it alone . Come , I'll go in with you .

I am very sorry that you are not well .


I am glad I have found this napkin ;
This was her first remembrance from the Moor ;
My wayward husband hath a hundred times 
Woo'd me to steal it , but she so loves the token ,
For he conjur'd her she should ever keep it ,
That she reserves it evermore about her 
To kiss and talk to . I'll have the work ta'en out ,
And give 't Iago :
What he will do with it heaven knows , not I ;
I nothing but to please his fantasy .


How now , what do you here alone ?

Do not you chide ; I have a thing for you .

A thing for me ? It is a common thing 

Ha !

To have a foolish wife .

O , is that all ? What will you give me now 
For that same handkerchief ?

What handkerchief ?

What handkerchief !
Why , that the Moor first gave to Desdemona :
That which so often you did bid me steal .

Hast stol'n it from her ?

No , faith ; she let it drop by negligence ,
And , to the advantage , I , being there , took't up .
Look , here it is .

A good wench ; give it me .

What will you do with 't , that you have been so earnest 
To have me filch it ?

Why , what's that to you ?


If it be not for some purpose of import 
Give 't me again ; poor lady , she'll run mad 
When she shall lack it .

Be not acknown on 't ; I have use for it .
Go , leave me .

I will in Cassio's lodging lose this napkin ,
And let him find it ; trifles light as air 
Are to the jealous confirmations strong 
As proofs of holy writ ; this may do something .
The Moor already changes with my poison :
Dangerous conceits are in their natures poisons ,
Which at the first are scarce found to distaste ,
But with a little act upon the blood ,
Burn like the mines of sulphur . I did say so :
Look , where he comes !


Not poppy , nor mandragora ,
Nor all the drowsy syrups of the world ,
Shall ever medicine thee to that sweet sleep 

Which thou ow'dst yesterday .

Ha , ha , false to me ?

Why , how now , generall no more of that .

Avaunt , be gone , thou hast set me on the rack ;
I swear 'tis better to be much abus'd 
Than but to know 't a little .

How now , my lord !

What sense had I of her stol'n hours of lust ?
I saw 't not , thought it not , it harm'd not me ;
I slept the next night well , was free and merry ;
I found not Cassio's kisses on her lips ;
He that is robb'd , not wanting what is stol'n ,
Let him not know 't and he's not robb'd at all .

I am sorry to hear this .

I had been happy , if the general camp ,
Pioners and all , had tasted her sweet body ,
So I had nothing known . O , now , for ever 
Farewell the tranquil mind ; farewell content !
Farewell the plumed troop and the big wars 
That make ambition virtue , O , farewell !
Farewell the neighing steed , and the shrill trump ,
The spirit-stirring drum , the ear-piercing fife ,
The royal banner , and all quality ,
Pride , pomp , and circumstance of glorious war !
And , O you mortal engines , whose rude throats 
The immortal Jove's dread clamours counterfeit ,
Farewell , Othello's occupation's gone !

Is it possible , my lord ?

Villain , be sure thou prove my love a whore ,
Be sure of it ; give me the ocular proof ;
Or , by the worth of mine eternal soul ,
Thou hadst been better have been born a dog 
Than answer my wak'd wrath .

Is 't come to this ?

Make me to see 't ; or , at the least , so prove it ,
That the probation bear no hinge nor loop 
To hang a doubt on ; or woe upon thy life !

My noble lord ,

If thou dost slander her and torture me ,
Never pray more ; abandon all remorse ;
On horror's head horrors accumulate ;
Do deeds to make heaven weep , all earth amaz'd ;
For nothing canst thou to damnation add 
Greater than that .

O grace , O heaven forgive me !
Are you a man , have you a soul or sense ?
God be wi' you ; take mine office . O wretched fool !
That liv'st to make thine honesty a vice .
O monstrous world , Take note , take note , O world !
To be direct and honest is not safe .
I thank you for this profit , and , from hence 
I'll love no friend , sith love breeds such offence .

Nay , stay ; thou shouldst be honest .

I should be wise ; for honesty's a fool ,
And loses that it works for .

By the world ,
I think my wife be honest and think she is not ;
I think that thou art just and think thou art not .
I'll have some proof . Her name , that was as fresh 
As Dian's visage , is now begrim'd and black 
As mine own face . If there be cords or knives ,
Poison or fire or suffocating streams ,
I'll not endure it . Would I were satisfied !

I see , sir , you are eaten up with passion .
I do repent me that I put it to you .
You would be satisfied ?

Would , nay , I will .

And may ; but how ? how satisfied , my lord ?
Would you , the supervisor , grossly gape on ;
Behold her tupp'd ?

Death and damnation , O !

It were a tedious difficulty , I think ,
To bring them to that prospect ; damn them then ,
If ever mortal eyes do see them bolster 
More than their own , What then ? how then ?
What shall I say ? Where's satisfaction ?
It is impossible you should see this ,
Were they as prime as goats , as hot as monkeys ,
As salt as wolves in pride , and fools as gross 
As ignorance made drunk ; but yet , I say ,
If imputation , and strong circumstances ,
Which lead directly to the door of truth ,
Will give you satisfaction , you may have it .

Give me a living reason she's disloyal .

I do not like the office ;
But , sith I am enter'd in this cause so far ,
Prick'd to 't by foolish honesty and love ,
I will go on . I lay with Cassio lately ;
And , being troubled with a raging tooth ,
I could not sleep .
There are a kind of men so loose of soul 
That in their sleeps will mutter their affairs ;
One of this kind is Cassio .
In sleep I heard him say , 'Sweet Desdemona ,
Let us be wary , let us hide our loves !' 
And then , sir , would he gripe and wring my hand ,
Cry , 'O , sweet creature !' and then kiss me hard ,
As if he pluck'd up kisses by the roots ,
That grew upon my lips ; then laid his leg 
Over my thigh , and sigh'd , and kiss'd ; and then 
Cried , 'Cursed fate , that gave thee to the Moor !' 

O monstrous , monstrous !

Nay , this was but his dream .

But this denoted a foregone conclusion :
'Tis a shrewd doubt , though it be but a dream .

And this may help to thicken other proofs 
That do demonstrate thinly .

I'll tear her all to pieces .

Nay , but be wise ; yet we see nothing done ;
She may be honest yet . Tell me but this :
Have you not sometimes seen a handkerchief 
Spotted with strawberries in your wife's hand ?

I gave her such a one ; 'twas my first gift .

I know not that ; but such a handkerchief 
I am sure it was your wife's did I to-day 
See Cassio wipe his beard with .

If it be that ,

If it be that , or any that was hers ,
It speaks against her with the other proofs .

O , that the slave had forty thousand lives ;
One is too poor , too weak for my revenge .
Now do I see 'tis true . Look here , Iago ;
All my fond love thus do I blow to heaven :
'Tis gone .
Arise , black vengeance , from the hollow hell !
Yield up , O love , thy crown and hearted throne 
To tyrannous hate . Swell , bosom , with thy fraught ,
For 'tis of aspics' tongues !

Yet be content .

O , blood , blood , blood !

Patience , I say ; your mind , perhaps , may change .

Never , Iago . Like to the Pontick sea ,
Whose icy current and compulsive course 
Ne'er feels retiring ebb , but keeps due on 
To the Propontic and the Hellespont ,
Even so my bloody thoughts , with violent pace ,
Shall ne'er look back , ne'er ebb to humble love ,
Till that a capable and wide revenge 
Swallow them up .

Now , by yond marble heaven ,
In the due reverence of a sacred vow 
I here engage my words .

Do not rise yet .

Witness , you ever-burning lights above !
You elements that clip us round about !
Witness , that here Iago doth give up 
The execution of his wit , hands , heart ,
To wrong'd Othello's service , Let him command ,
And to obey shall be in me remorse ,
What bloody business ever .

I greet thy love ,
Not with vain thanks , but with acceptance bounteous ,
And will upon the instant put thee to 't :
Within these three days let me hear thee say 
That Cassio's not alive .

My friend is dead ; 'tis done at your request :
But let her live .

Damn her , lewd minx , O , damn her !
Come , go with me apart ; I will withdraw 
To furnish me with some swift means of death 
For the fair devil . Now art thou my lieutenant .

I am your own for ever .


Do you know , sirrah , where Lieutenant Cassio lies ?

I dare not say he lies any where .

Why , man ?

He is a soldier ; and for one to say a soldier lies , is stabbing .

Go to ; where lodges he ?

To tell you where he lodges is to tell you where I lie .

Can anything be made of this ?

I know not where he lodges , and for me to devise a lodging , and say he lies here or he lies there , were to lie in mine own throat .

Can you inquire him out , and be edified by report ?

I will catechize the world for him ; that is , make questions , and by them answer .

Seek him , bid him come hither ; tell him I have moved my lord in his behalf , and hope all will be well .

To do this is within the compass of man's wit , and therefore I will attempt the doing it .


Where should I lose that handkerchief , Emilia ?

I know not , madam .

Believe me , I had rather have lost my purse 
Full of cruzadoes ; and , but my noble Moor 
Is true of mind , and made of no such baseness 
As jealous creatures are , it were enough 
To put him to ill thinking .

Is he not jealous ?

Who , he ? I think the sun where he was born 
Drew all such humours from him .

Look , where he comes .

I will not leave him now till Cassio 
Be call'd to him .

How is 't with you , my lord ?

Well , my good lady .

O , hardness to dissemble .
How do you , Desdemona ?

Well , my good lord .

Give me your hand . This hand is moist , my lady .

It yet has felt no age nor known no sorrow .

This argues fruitfulness and liberal heart ;
Hot , hot , and moist ; this hand of yours requires 
A sequester from liberty , fasting and prayer ,
Much castigation , exercise devout ;
For here's a young and sweating devil here ,
That commonly rebels . 'Tis a good hand ,
A frank one .

You may , indeed , say so ;
For 'twas that hand that gave away my heart .

A liberal hand ; the hearts of old gave hands ,
But our new heraldry is hands not hearts .

I cannot speak of this . Come now , your promise .

What promise , chuck ?

I have sent to bid Cassio come speak with you .

I have a salt and sorry rheum offends me .
Lend me thy handkerchief .

Here , my lord .

That which I gave you .

I have it not about me .

Not ?

No , indeed , my lord .

That is a fault .
That handkerchief 
Did an Egyptian to my mother give ;
She was a charmer , and could almost read 
The thoughts of people ; she told her , while she kept it ,
'Twould make her amiable and subdue my father 
Entirely to her love , but if she lost it 
Or made a gift of it , my father's eye 
Should hold her loathed , and his spirits should hunt 
After new fancies . She dying gave it me ;
And bid me , when my fate would have me wive ,
To give it her . I did so : and take heed on 't ;
Make it a darling like your precious eye ;
To lose't or give't away , were such perdition 
As nothing else could match .

Is 't possible ?

'Tis true ; there's magic in the web of it ;
A sibyl , that had number'd in the world 
The sun to course two hundred compasses ,
In her prophetic fury sew'd the work ;
The worms were hallow'd that did breed the silk ,
And it was dy'd in mummy which the skilful 
Conserv'd of maidens' hearts .

Indeed , is 't true ?

Most veritable ; therefore look to 't well .

Then would to heaven that I had never seen it !

Ha , wherefore ?

Why do you speak so startingly and rash ?

Is 't lost ? is 't gone ? speak , is it out o' the way ?

Heaven bless us !

Say you ?

It is not lost : but what an if it were ?

How !

I say , it is not lost .

Fetch 't , let me see 't .

Why , so I can , sir , but I will not now .
This is a trick to put me from my suit :
Pray you let Cassio be receiv'd again .

Fetch me the handkerchief ; my mind misgives .

Come , come ;
You'll never meet a more sufficient man .

The handkerchief !

I pray , talk me of Cassio .

The handkerchief !

A man that all his time 
Hath founded his good fortunes on your love ,
Shar'd dangers with you ,

The handkerchief !

In sooth you are to blame .

Away !


Is not this man jealous ?

I ne'er saw this before .
Sure , there's some wonder in this handkerchief ;
I am most unhappy in the loss of it .

'Tis not a year or two shows us a man ;
They are all but stomachs , and we all but food ;
They eat us hungerly , and when they are full 
They belch us . Look you , Cassio and my husband .


There is no other way ; 'tis she must do 't :
And , lo , the happiness : go and importune her .

How now , good Cassio , what's the news with you ?

Madam , my former suit : I do beseech you 
That by your virtuous means I may again 
Exist , and be a member of his love 
Whom I with all the office of my heart 
Entirely honour ; I would not be delay'd .
If my offence be of such mortal kind 
That nor my service past , nor present sorrows ,
Nor purpos'd merit in futurity ,
Can ransom me into his love again ,
But to know so must be my benefit ;
So shall I clothe me in a forc'd content ,
And shut myself up in some other course 
To fortune's alms .

Alas , thrice-gentle Cassio !
My advocation is not now in tune ;
My lord is not my lord ; nor should I know him ,
Were he in favour as in humour alter'd .
So help me every spirit sanctified ,
As I have spoken for you all my best 
And stood within the blank of his displeasure 
For my free speech . You must awhile be patient ;
What I can do I will , and more I will 
Than for myself I dare : let that suffice you .

Is my lord angry ?

He went hence but now ,
And , certainly in strange unquietness .

Can he be angry ? I have seen the cannon ,
When it hath blown his ranks into the air ,
And , like the devil , from his very arm 
Puff'd his own brother ; and can he be angry ?
Something of moment then ; I will go meet him ;
There's matter in 't indeed , if he be angry .

I prithee , do so .

Something , sure , of state ,
Either from Venice , or some unhatch'd practice 
Made demonstrable here in Cyprus to him ,
Hath puddled his clear spirit ; and , in such cases 
Men's natures wrangle with inferior things ,
Though great ones are their object . 'Tis even so ;
For let our finger ache , and it indues 
Our other healthful members ev'n to that sense 
Of pain . Nay , we must think men are not gods ,
Nor of them look for such observancy 
As fits the bridal . Beshrew me much , Emilia ,
I was unhandsome warrior as I am 
Arraigning his unkindness with my soul ;
But now I find I had suborn'd the witness ,
And he's indicted falsely .

Pray heaven it be state-matters , as you think ,
And no conception , nor no jealous toy 
Concerning you .

Alas the day , I never gave him cause .

But jealous souls will not be answer'd so ;
They are not ever jealous for the cause ,
But jealous for they are jealous ; 'tis a monster 
Begot upon itself , born on itself .

Heaven keep that monster from Othello's mind !

Lady , amen .

I will go seek him . Cassio , walk hereabout ;
If I do find him fit , I'll move your suit 
And seek to effect it to my uttermost .

I humbly thank your ladyship .

Save you , friend Cassio !

What make you from home ?
How is it with you , my most fair Bianca ?
I' faith , sweet love , I was coming to your house .

And I was going to your lodging , Cassio .
What , keep a week away ? seven days and nights ?
Eight score eight hours ? and lovers' absent hours ,
More tedious than the dial eight score times ?
O weary reckoning !

Pardon me , Bianca ,
I have this while with leaden thoughts been press'd ,
But I shall , in a more continuate time ,
Strike off this score of absence . Sweet Bianca .

Take me this work out .

O Cassio , whence came this ?
This is some token from a newer friend ;
To the felt absence now I feel a cause ;
Is 't come to this ? Well , well .

Go to , woman !
Throw your vile guesses in the devil's teeth ,
From whence you have them . You are jealous now 
That this is from some mistress , some remembrance :
No , in good troth , Bianca .

Why , whose is it ?

I know not , sweet ; I found it in my chamber .
I like the work well ; ere it be demanded ,
As like enough it will ,I'd have it copied ;
Take it and do 't ; and leave me for this time .

Leave you , wherefore ?

I do attend here on the general ,
And think it no addition nor my wish 
To have him see me woman'd .

Why , I pray you ?

Not that I love you not .

But that you do not love me .
I pray you , bring me on the way a little 
And say if I shall see you soon at night .

'Tis but a little way that I can bring you ,
For I attend here ; but I'll see you soon .

'Tis very good ; I must be circumstanc'd .

Will you think so ?

Think so , Iago !

What !
To kiss in private ?

An unauthoriz'd kiss .

Or to be naked with her friend a-bed 
An hour or more , not meaning any harm ?

Naked a-bed , Iago , and not mean harm ?
It is hypocrisy against the devil :
They that mean virtuously , and yet do so ,
The devil their virtue tempts , and they tempt heaven .

If they do nothing , 'tis a venial slip ;
But if I give my wife a handkerchief ,

What then ?

Why , then , 'tis hers , my lord ; and , being hers ,
She may , I think , bestow 't on any man .

She is protectress of her honour too ;
May she give that ?

Her honour is an essence that's not seen ;
They have it very oft that have it not :
But for the handkerchief ,

By heaven , I would most gladly have forgot it :
Thou said'st ,O , it comes o'er my memory ,
As doth the raven o'er the infected house ,
Boding to all ,he had my handkerchief .

Ay , what of that ?

That's not so good now .

What ,
If I had said I had seen him do you wrong ?
Or heard him say , as knaves be such abroad ,
Who having , by their own importunate suit ,
Or voluntary dotage of some mistress ,
Convinced or supplied them , cannot choose 
But they must blab .

Hath he said any thing ?

He hath , my lord ; but be you well assur'd ,
No more than he'll unswear .

What hath he said ?

Faith , that he did I know not what he did .

What ? what ?

Lie 

With her ?

With her , on her ; what you will .

Lie with her , lie on her , We say , lie on her , when they belie her . Lie with her , that's fulsome . Handkerchief ,confessions ,handkerchief , To confess , and be hanged for his labour . First , to be hanged , and then to confess : I tremble at it . Nature would not invest herself in such shadowing passion without some instruction . It is not words that shake me thus . Pish , Noses , ears , and lips . Is it possible ?Confess !Handkerchief !O devil !


Work on ,
My medicine , work , Thus credulous fools are caught ;
And many worthy and chaste dames even thus ,
All guitless , meet reproach . What , ho , my lord !
My lord , I say , Othello !

How now , Cassio !

What's the matter ?

My lord is fallen into an epilepsy ;
This is his second fit ; he had one yesterday .

Rub him about the temples .

No , forbear ;
The lethargy must have his quiet course ,
If not he foams at mouth , and by and by 
Breaks out to savage madness . Look , he stirs ;
Do you withdraw yourself a little while ,
He will recover straight ; when he is gone ,
I would on great occasion speak with you .

How is it , general ? have you not hurt your head ?

Dost thou mock me ?

I mock you , no , by heaven .
Would you would bear your fortune like a man !

A horned man's a monster and a beast .

There's many a beast then , in a populous city ,
And many a civil monster .

Did he confess it ?

Good sir , be a man ;
Think every bearded fellow that's but yok'd 
May draw with you ; there's millions now alive 
That nightly lie in those unproper beds 
Which they dare swear peculiar ; your case is better .
O , 'tis the spite of hell , the fiend's arch-mock ,
To lip a wanton in a secure couch ,
And to suppose her chaste . No , let me know ;
And knowing what I am I know what she shall be .

O , thou art wise ; 'tis certain .

Stand you awhile apart ;
Confine yourself but in a patient list .
Whilst you were here o'erwhelmed with your grief ,
A passion most unsuiting such a man ,
Cassio came hither ; I shifted him away ,
And laid good 'scuse upon your ecstasy ;
Bade him anon return and here speak with me ;
The which he promis'd . Do but encave yourself ,
And mark the fleers , the gibes , and notable scorns ,
That dwell in every region of his face ;
For I will make him tell the tale anew ,
Where , how , how oft , how long ago , and when 
He hath , and is again to cope your wife :
I say , but mark his gesture . Marry , patience ;
Or I shall say you are all in all in spleen ,
And nothing of a man .

Dost thou hear , Iago ?
I will be found most cunning in my patience ;
But dost thou hear ?most bloody .

That's not amiss ;
But yet keep time in all . Will you withdraw ?

Now will I question Cassio of Bianca ,
A housewife that by selling her desires 
Buys herself bread and clothes ; it is a creature 
That dotes on Cassio ; as 'tis the strumpet's plague 
To beguile many and be beguil'd by one .
He , when he hears of her , cannot refrain 
From the excess of laughter . Here he comes :


As he shall smile , Othello shall go mad ;
And his unbookish jealousy must construe 
Poor Cassio's smiles , gestures , and light behaviour 

Quite in the wrong . How do you now , lieutenant ?

The worser that you give me the addition 
Whose want even kills me .

Ply Desdemona well , and you are sure on 't .


Now , if this suit lay in Bianca's power ,
How quickly should you speed !

Alas , poor caitiff !

Look , how he laughs already !

I never knew woman love man so .

Alas , poor rogue , I think , i' faith , she loves me .

Now he denies it faintly , and laughs it out .

Do you hear , Cassio ?

Now he importunes him 
To tell it o'er : go to ; well said , well said .

She gives it out that you shall marry her ;
Do you intend it ?

Ha , ha , ha !

Do you triumph , Roman ? do you triumph ?

I marry her , what ? a customer ? I prithee , bear some charity to my wit ; do not think it so unwholesome . Ha , ha , ha !

So , so , so , so . They laugh that win .

Faith , the cry goes that you shall marry her .

Prithee , say true .

I am a very villain else .

Have you scored me ? Well .

This is the monkey's own giving out : she is persuaded I will marry her , out of her own love and flattery , not out of my promise .

Iago beckons me ; now he begins the story .

She was here even now ; she haunts me in every place . I was the other day talking on the sea bank with certain Venetians , and thither come this bauble , and , by this hand , she falls me thus about my neck ;

Crying , 'O dear Cassio !' as it were ; his gesture imports it .

So hangs and lolls and weeps upon me ; so hales and pulls me ; ha , ha , ha !

Now he tells how she plucked him to my chamber . O , I see that nose of yours , but not the dog I shall throw it to .

Well , I must leave her company .

Before me , look , where she comes .

'Tis such another fitchew , marry , a perfumed one .

What do you mean by this haunting of me ?

Let the devil and his dam haunt you , What did you mean by that same handkerchief you gave me even now ? I was a fine fool to take it . I must take out the work , A likely piece of work , that you should find it in your chamber , and not know who left it there , This is some minx's token , and I must take out the work , There , give it your hobby-horse ; wheresoever you had it I'll take out no work on 't .

How now , my sweet Bianca , how now , how now !

By heaven , that should be my handkerchief !

An you'll come to supper to-night , you may ; an you will not , come when you are next prepared for .


After her , after her .

Faith , I must ; she'll rail in the street else .

Will you sup there ?

Faith , I intend so .

Well , I may chance to see you , for I would very fain speak with you .

Prithee , come ; will you ?

Go to ; say no more .


How shall I murder him , Iago ?

Did you perceive how he laughed at his vice ?

O , Iago !

And did you see the handkerchief ?

Was that mine ?

Yours , by this hand ; and to see how he prizes the foolish woman your wife , she gave it him , and he hath given it his whore .

I would have him nine years a-killing .
A fine woman , a fair woman , a sweet woman !

Nay , you must forget that .

Ay , let her rot , and perish , and be damned to-night ; for she shall not live . No , my heart is turned to stone ; I strike it , and it hurts my hand . O , the world hath not a sweeter creature ; she might lie by an emperor's side and command him tasks .

Nay , that's not your way .

Hang her , I do but say what she is . So delicate with her needle , An admirable musician , O , she will sing the savageness out of a bear . Of so high and plenteous wit and invention !

She's the worse for all this .

O , a thousand , a thousand times . And then , of so gentle a condition !

Ay , too gentle .

Nay , that's certain ;but yet the pity of it , Iago , O , Iago , the pity of it , Iago !

If you are so fond over her iniquity , give her patent to offend ; for , if it touch not you , it comes near nobody .

I will chop her into messes . Cuckold me !

O , 'tis foul in her .

With mine officer !

That's fouler .

Get me some poison , Iago ; this night : I'll not expostulate with her , lest her body and beauty unprovide my mind again . This night , Iago .

Do it not with poison , strangle her in her bed , even the bed she hath contaminated .

Good , good ; the justice of it pleases ; very good .

And for Cassio , let me be his undertaker ; you shall hear more by midnight .

Excellent good .

What trumpet is that same ?

Something from Venice , sure . 'Tis Lodovico ,
Come from the duke ; and see , your wife is with him .


God save you , worthy general !

With all my heart , sir .

The duke and senators of Venice greet you .


I kiss the instrument of their pleasures .


And what's the news , good cousin Lodovico ?

I am very glad to see you , signior ;
Welcome to Cyprus .

I thank you . How does Lieutenant Cassio ?

Lives , sir .

Cousin , there's fall'n between him and my lord 
An unkind breach ; but you shall make all well .

Are you sure of that ?

My lord ?

This fail you not to do , as you will 

He did not call ; he's busy in the paper .
Is there division 'twixt my lord and Cassio ?

A most unhappy one ; I would do much 
To atone them , for the love I bear to Cassio .

Fire and brimstone !

My lord ?

Are you wise ?

What , is he angry ?

May be the letter mov'd him ;
For , as I think , they do command him home ,
Deputing Cassio in his government .

Trust me , I am glad on 't .

Indeed !

My lord ?

I am glad to see you mad .

Why , sweet Othello ?

Devil !


I have not deserved this .

My lord , this would not be believ'd in Venice ,
Though I should swear I saw 't : 'tis very much ;
Make her amends , she weeps .

O devil , devil !
If that the earth could teem with woman's tears ,
Each drop she falls would prove a crocodile .
Out of my sight !

I will not stay to offend you .


Truly , an obedient lady ;
I do beseech your lordship , call her back .

Mistress !

My lord ?

What would you with her , sir ?

Who , I , my lord ?

Ay ; you did wish that I would make her turn :
Sir , she can turn , and turn , and yet go on ,
And turn again ; and she can weep , sir , weep ;
And she's obedient , as you say , obedient ,
Very obedient . Proceed you in your tears .
Concerning this , sir ,O well-painted passion !
I am commanded home . Get you away ;
I'll send for you anon . Sir , I obey the mandate ,
And will return to Venice . Hence , avaunt !

Cassio shall have my place . And , sir , to-night ,
I do entreat that we may sup together ;
You are welcome , sir , to Cyprus . Goats and monkeys !


Is this the noble Moor whom our full senate 
Call all-in-all sufficient ? is this the noble nature 
Whom passion could not shake ? whose solid virtue 
The shot of accident nor dart of chance 
Could neither graze nor pierce ?

He is much chang'd .

Are his wits safe ? is he not light of brain ?

He's that he is ; I may not breathe my censure .
What he might be , if , what he might , he is not ,
I would to heaven he were !

What , strike his wife !

Faith , that was not so well ; yet would I knew 
That stroke would prove the worst !

Is it his use ?
Or did the letters work upon his blood ,
And new-create this fault ?

Alas , alas !
It is not honesty in me to speak 
What I have seen and known . You shall observe him ,
And his own courses will denote him so 
That I may save my speech . Do but go after 
And mark how he continues .

I am sorry that I am deceiv'd in him .


You have seen nothing , then ?

Nor ever heard , nor ever did suspect .

Yes , you have seen Cassio and her together .

But then I saw no harm , and then I heard 
Each syllable that breath made up between them .

What , did they never whisper ?

Never , my lord .

Nor send you out o' the way ?

Never .

To fetch her fan , her gloves , her mask , nor nothing ?

Never , my lord .

That's strange .

I durst , my lord , to wager she is honest ,
Lay down my soul at stake : if you think other ,
Remove your thought ; it doth abuse your bosom .
If any wretch have put this in your head ,
Let heaven requite it with the serpent's curse !
For , if she be not honest , chaste , and true ,
There's no man happy ; the purest of their wives 
Is foul as slander .

Bid her come hither ; go .

She says enough ; yet she's a simple bawd 
That cannot say as much . This is a subtle whore ,
A closet lock and key of villanous secrets ;
And yet she'll kneel and pray ; I have seen her do 't .


My lord , what is your will ?

Pray , chuck , come hither .

What is your pleasure ?

Let me see your eyes ;
Look in my face .

What horrible fancy's this ?

Some of your function , mistress ;
Leave procreants alone and shut the door ;
Cough or cry 'hem' if any body come ;
Your mystery , your mystery ; nay , dispatch .


Upon my knees , what doth your speech import ?
I understand a fury in your words ,
But not the words .

Why , what art thou ?

Your wife , my lord ; your true 
And loyal wife .

Come , swear it , damn thyself ;
Lest , being like one of heaven , the devils themselves 
Should fear to seize thee ; therefore be double-damn'd ;
Swear thou art honest .

Heaven doth truly know it .

Heaven truly knows that thou art false as hell .

To whom , my lord ? with whom ? how am I false ?

Ah , Desdemona ; away , away , away !

Alas , the heavy day !Why do you weep ?
Am I the motive of these tears , my lord ?
If haply you my father do suspect 
An instrument of this your calling back ,
Lay not your blame on me ; if you have lost him ,
Why , I have lost him too .

Had it pleas'd heaven 
To try me with affliction , had he rain'd 
All kinds of sores , and shames , on my bare head ,
Steep'd me in poverty to the very lips ,
Given to captivity me and my utmost hopes ,
I should have found in some part of my soul 
A drop of patience ; but , alas , to make me 
The fixed figure for the time of scorn 
To point his slow and moving finger at ;
Yet could I bear that too ; well , very well :
But there , where I have garner'd up my heart ,
Where either I must live or bear no life ,
The fountain from the which my current runs 
Or else dries up ; to be discarded thence !
Or keep it as a cistern for foul toads 
To knot and gender in , Turn thy complexion there ,
Patience , thou young and rose-lipp'd cherubin ;
Ay , there , look grim as hell !

I hope my noble lord esteems me honest .

O , ay ; as summer flies are in the shambles ,
That quicken even with blowing . O thou weed !
Who art so lovely fair and smell'st so sweet 
That the sense aches at thee , would thou hadst ne'er been born .

Alas , what ignorant sin have I committed ?

Was this fair paper , this most goodly book ,
Made to write 'whore' upon ? What committed !
Committed , O thou public commoner !
I should make very forges of my cheeks ,
That would to cinders burn up modesty ,
Did I but speak thy deeds . What committed !
Heaven stops the nose at it and the moon winks ,
The bawdy wind that kisses all it meets 
Is hush'd within the hollow mine of earth ,
And will not hear it . What committed !
Impudent strumpet !

By heaven , you do me wrong .

Are not you a strumpet ?

No , as I am a Christian .
If to preserve this vessel for my lord 
From any other foul unlawful touch 
Be not to be a strumpet , I am none .

What , not a whore ?

No , as I shall be sav'd .

Is it possible ?

O , heaven forgive us .

I cry you mercy , then ;
I took you for that cunning whore of Venice 
That married with Othello . You , mistress ,
That have the office opposite to Saint Peter ,
And keep the gate of hell !


You , you , ay , you !
We have done our course ; there's money for your pains .
I pray you , turn the key and keep our counsel .

Alas , what does this gentleman conceive ?
How do you , madam ? how do you , my good lady ?

Faith , half asleep .

Good madam , what's the matter with my lord ?

With who ?

Why , with my lord , madam .

Who is thy lord ?

He that is yours , sweet lady .

I have none ; do not talk to me , Emilia ;
I cannot weep , nor answer have I none ,
But what should go by water . Prithee , to-night 
Lay on my bed my wedding sheets : remember :
And call thy husband hither .

Here is a change indeed !


'Tis meet I should be us'd so , very meet .
How have I been behav'd , that he might stick 
The small'st opinion on my least misuse ?


What is your pleasure , madam ? How is it with you ?

I cannot tell . Those that do teach young babes 
Do it with gentle means and easy tasks ;
He might have chid me so ; for , in good faith ,
I am a child to chiding .

What's the matter , lady ?

Alas , Iago , my lord hath so bewhor'd her ,
Thrown such despite and heavy terms upon her ,
As true hearts cannot bear .

Am I that name , Iago ?

What name , fair lady ?

Such as she says my lord did say I was .

He call'd her whore ; a beggar in his drink 
Could not have laid such terms upon his callat .

Why did he so ?

I do not know ; I am sure I am none such .

Do not weep , do not weep . Alas the day !

Has she forsook so many noble matches ,
Her father and her country and her friends ,
To be call'd whore ? would it not make one weep ?

It is my wretched fortune .

Beshrew him for it !
How comes this trick upon him ?

Nay , heaven doth know .

I will be hang'd , if some eternal villain ,
Some busy and insinuating rogue ,
Some cogging cozening slave , to get some office ,
Have not devis'd this slander ; I'll be hang'd else .

Fie , there is no such man ; it is impossible .

If any such there be , heaven pardon him !

A halter pardon him , and hell gnaw his bones !
Why should he call her whore ? who keeps her company ?
What place ? what time ? what form ? what likelihood ?
The Moor's abus'd by some most villanous knave ,
Some base notorious knave , some scurvy fellow .
O heaven , that such companions thou'dst unfold ,
And put in every honest hand a whip 
To lash the rascals naked through the world ,
Even from the east to the west !

Speak within door .

O , fie upon them . Some such squire he was 
That turn'd your wit the seamy side without ,
And made you to suspect me with the Moor .

You are a fool ; go to .

O good Iago ,
What shall I do to win my lord again ?
Good friend , go to him ; for , by this light of heaven ,
I know not how I lost him . Here I kneel :
If e'er my will did trespass 'gainst his love ,
Either in discourse of thought or actual deed ,
Or that mine eyes , mine ears , or any sense ,
Delighted them in any other form ;
Or that I do not yet , and ever did ,
And ever will , though he do shake me off 
To beggarly divorcement , love him dearly ,
Comfort forswear me , Unkindness may do much ;
And his unkindness may defeat my life ,
But never taint my love . I cannot say 'whore :' 
It does abhor me now I speak the word ;
To do the act that might the addition earn 
Not the world's mass of vanity could make me .

I pray you be content , 'tis but his humour ;
The business of the state does him offence ,
And he does chide with you .

If 'twere no other ,

'Tis but so , I warrant .

Hark , how these instruments summon to supper ;
The messengers of Venice stay the meat :
Go in , and weep not ; all things shall be well .


How now , Roderigo !

I do not find that thou dealest justly with me .

What in the contrary ?

Every day thou daffest me with some device , Iago ; and rather , as it seems to me now , keepest from me all conveniency , than suppliest me with the least advantage of hope . I will indeed no longer endure it , nor am I yet persuaded to put up in peace what already I have foolishly suffered .

Will you hear me , Roderigo ?

Faith , I have heard too much , for your words and performances are no kin together .

You charge me most unjustly .

With nought but truth . I have wasted myself out of my means . The jewels you have had from me to deliver to Desdemona would half have corrupted a votarist ; you have told me she has received them , and returned me expectations and comforts of sudden respect and acquaintance , but I find none .

Well ; go to ; very well .

Very well , go to , I cannot go to , man ; nor 'tis not very well : by this hand , I say , it is very scurvy , and begin to find myself fobbed in it .

Very well .

I tell you 'tis not very well . I will make myself known to Desdemona ; if she will return me my jewels , I will give over my suit and repent my unlawful solicitation ; if not , assure yourself I will seek satisfaction of you .

You have said now .

Ay , and said nothing , but what I protest intendment of doing .

Why , now I see there's mettle in thee , and even from this instant do build on thee a better opinion than ever before . Give me thy hand , Roderigo ; thou hast taken against me a most just exception ; but yet , I protest , I have dealt most directly in thy affair .

It hath not appeared .

I grant indeed it hath not appeared , and your suspicion is not without wit and judgment . But , Roderigo , if thou hast that in thee indeed , which I have greater reason to believe now than ever , I mean purpose , courage , and valour , this night show it : if thou the next night following enjoy not Desdemona , take me from this world with treachery and devise engines for my life .

Well , what is it ? is it within reason and compass ?

Sir , there is especial commission come from Venice to depute Cassio in Othello's place .

Is that true ? why , then Othello and Desdemona return again to Venice .

O , no , he goes into Mauritania , and takes away with him the fair Desdemona , unless his abode be lingered here by some accident ; wherein none can be so determinate as the removing of Cassio .

How do you mean , removing of him ?

Why , by making him uncapable of Othello's place ; knocking out his brains .

And that you would have me do ?

Ay ; if you dare do yourself a profit and a right . He sups to-night with a harlotry , and thither will I go to him ; he knows not yet of his honourable fortune . If you will watch his going thence ,which I will fashion to fall out between twelve and one ,you may take him at your pleasure ; I will be near to second your attempt , and he shall fall between us . Come , stand not amazed at it , but go along with me ; I will show you such a necessity in his death that you shall think yourself bound to put it on him . It is now high supper-time , and the night grows to waste ; about it .

I will hear further reason for this .

And you shall be satisfied .


I do beseech you , sir , trouble yourself no further .

O , pardon me ; 'twill do me good to walk .

Madam , good night ; I humbly thank your ladyship .

Your honour is most welcome .

Will you walk , sir ?
O , Desdemona ,

My lord ?

Get you to bed on the instant ; I will be returned forthwith ; dismiss your attendant there ; look it be done .

I will , my lord .


How goes it now ? he looks gentler than he did .

He says he will return incontinent ;
He hath commanded me to go to bed ,
And bade me to dismiss you .

Dismiss me !

It was his bidding ; therefore , good Emilia ,
Give me my nightly wearing , and adieu :
We must not now displease him .

I would you had never seen him .

So would not I ; my love doth so approve him ,
That even his stubbornness , his checks and frowns ,
Prithee , unpin me ,have grace and favour in them .

I have laid those sheets you bade me on the bed .

All's one . Good faith , how foolish are our minds !
If I do die before thee , prithee , shroud me 
In one of those same sheets .

Come , come , you talk .

My mother had a maid call'd Barbara ;
She was in love , and he she lov'd prov'd mad 
And did forsake her ; she had a song of 'willow ;' 
An old thing 'twas , but it express'd her fortune ,
And she died singing it ; that song to-night 
Will not go from my mind ; I have much to do 
But to go hang my head all at one side ,
And sing it like poor Barbara . Prithee , dispatch .

Shall I go fetch your night-gown ?

No , unpin me here .
This Lodovico is a proper man .

A very handsome man .

He speaks well .

I know a lady in Venice would have walked barefoot to Palestine for a touch of his nether lip .


The poor soul sat sighing by a sycamore tree ,
Sing all a green willow ;
Her hand on her bosom , her head on her knee ,
Sing willow , willow , willow :
The fresh streams ran by her , and murmur'd her moans ;
Sing willow , willow , willow :
Her salt tears fell from her , and soften'd the stones ;

Lay by these :

Sing willow , willow , willow :

Prithee , hie thee ; he'll come anon .

Sing all a green willow must be my garland .
Let nobody blame him , his scorn I approve ,

Nay , that's not next . Hark , who is it that knocks ?

It is the wind .


I call'd my love false love ; but what said he then ?
Sing willow , willow , willow :
If I court moe women , you'll couch with moe men .

So , get thee gone ; good night . Mine eyes do itch ;
Doth that bode weeping ?

'Tis neither here nor there .

I have heard it said so . O , these men , these men !
Dost thou in conscience think , tell me , Emilia ,
That there be women do abuse their husbands 
In such gross kind ?

There be some such , no question .

Wouldst thou do such a deed for all the world ?

Why , would not you ?

No , by this heavenly light !

Nor I neither by this heavenly light ; might do 't as well i' the dark .

Wouldst thou do such a deed for all the world ?

The world is a huge thing ; 'tis a great price 
For a small vice .

In troth , I think thou wouldst not .

In troth , I think I should , and undo 't when I had done . Marry , I would not do such a thing for a joint-ring , nor measures of lawn , nor for gowns , petticoats , nor caps , nor any petty exhibition ; but for the whole world , who would not make her husband a cuckold to make him a monarch ? I should venture purgatory for 't .

Beshrew me , if I would do such a wrong 
For the whole world .

Why , the wrong is but a wrong i' the world ; and having the world for your labour , 'tis a wrong in your own world , and you might quickly make it right .

I do not think there is any such woman .

Yes , a dozen ; and as many to the vantage , as would store the world they played for .
But I do think it is their husbands' faults 
If wives do fall . Say that they slack their duties ,
And pour our treasures into foreign laps ,
Or else break out in peevish jealousies ,
Throwing restraint upon us ; or , say they strike us ,
Or scant our former having in despite ;
Why , we have galls , and though we have some grace ,
Yet have we some revenge . Let husbands know 
Their wives have sense like them ; they see and smell ,
And have their palates both for sweet and sour ,
As husbands have . What is it that they do 
When they change us for others ? Is it sport ?
I think it is ; and doth affection breed it ?
I think it doth : is 't frailty that thus errs ?
It is so too ; and have not we affections ,
Desires for sport , and frailty , as men have ?
Then , let them use us well ; else let them know ,
The ills we do , their ills instruct us so .

Good night , good night ; heaven me such usage send ,
Not to pick bad from bad , but by bad mend !

Here , stand behind this bulk ; straight will he come :
Wear thy good rapier bare , and put it home .
Quick , quick ; fear nothing ; I'll be at thy elbow .
It makes us , or it mars us ; think on that ,
And fix most firm thy resolution .

Be near at hand ; I may miscarry in 't .

Here , at thy hand : be bold , and take thy stand .


I have no great devotion to the deed ;
And yet he has given me satisfying reasons :
'Tis but a man gone : forth , my sword ; he dies .

I have rubb'd this young quat almost to the sense ,
And he grows angry . Now , whether he kill Cassio ,
Or Cassio him , or each do kill the other ,
Every way makes my gain : live Roderigo ,
He calls me to a restitution large 
Of gold and jewels that I bobb'd from him ,
As gifts to Desdemona ;
It must not be : if Cassio do remain ,
He hath a daily beauty in his life 
That makes me ugly ; and , besides , the Moor 
May unfold me to him ; there stand I in much peril .
No , he must die . But so ; I hear him coming .


I know his gait ; 'tis he . Villain , thou diest !


That thrust had been mine enemy indeed 
But that my coat is better than thou know'st ;
I will make proof of thine .


O , I am slain .


I am maim'd for ever . Help , ho , murder , murder !

The voice of Cassio : Iago keeps his word .

O , villain that I am !

It is e'en so .

O , help , ho , light , a surgeon !

'Tis he : O brave Iago , honest and just !
That hast such noble sense of thy friend's wrong ;
Thou teachest me . Minion , your dear lies dead ,
And your unblest fate hies ; strumpet , I come !
Forth of my heart those charms , thine eyes , are blotted ;
Thy bed lust-stain'd shall with lust's blood be spotted .

What ho , no watch ? no passage ? murder , murder !

'Tis some mischance ; the cry is very direful .

O , help !

Hark !

O wretched villain !

Two or three groan : it is a heavy night ;
These may be counterfeits ; let's think 't unsafe 
To come in to the cry without more help .

Nobody come ? then shall I bleed to death .

Hark !


Here's one comes in his shirt , with light and weapons .

Who's there ? whose noise is this that cries on murder ?

We do not know .

Did not you hear a cry ?

Here , here , for heaven's sake , help me .

What's the matter ?

This is Othello's ancient , as I take it .

The same indeed ; a very valiant fellow .

What are you here that cry so grievously ?

Iago ? O , I am spoil'd , undone by villains !
Give me some help .

O me , lieutenant , what villains have done this ?

I think that one of them is hereabout ,
And cannot make away .

O treacherous villains !


What are you there ? come in , and give some help .

O , help me here .

That's one of them .

O murderous slave , O villain !


O damn'd Iago , O inhuman dog !

Kill men i' the dark , Where be these bloody thieves ?
How silent is this town , Ho , murder , murder !
What may you be ? are you of good or evil ?

As you shall prove us , praise us .

Signior Lodovico ?

He , sir .

I cry you mercy . Here's Cassio hurt by villains .

Cassio !

How is it , brother ?

My leg is cut in two .

Marry , heaven forbid ,
Light , gentlemen ; I'll bind it with my shirt .


What is the matter , ho ? who is 't that cried ?

Who is 't that cried !

O my dear Cassio , my sweet Cassio !
O Cassio , Cassio , Cassio !

O notable strumpet , Cassio , may you suspect 
Who they should be that have thus mangled you ?

No .

I am sorry to find you thus ; I have been to seek you .

Lend me a garter . So . O , for a chair ,
To bear him easily hence !

Alas , he faints , O Cassio , Cassio , Cassio !

Gentlemen all , I do suspect this trash 
To be a party in this injury .
Patience awhile , good Cassio . Come , come .
Lend me a light . Know we this face , or no ?
Alas , my friend and my dear countryman ,
Roderigo ? no : yes , sure , O heaven , Roderigo .

What , of Venice ?

Even he , sir : did you know him ?

Know him , ay .

Signior Gratiano ? I cry you gentle pardon ;
These bloody accidents must excuse my manners ,
That so neglected you .

I am glad to see you .

How do you , Cassio ? O , a chair , a chair !

Roderigo !


He , he , 'tis he .O , that's well said ; the chair :
Some good men bear him carefully from hence ;
I'll fetch the general's surgeon .

For you , mistress ,
Save you your labour . He that lies slain here , Cassio ,
Was my dear friend . What malice was between you ?

None in the world ; nor do I know the man .

What , look you pale ? O , bear him out o' the air 

Stay you , good gentlemen . Look you pale , mistress ?
Do you perceive the gastness of her eye ?
Nay , if you stare , we shall hear more anon .
Behold her well ; I pray you , look upon her :
Do you see , gentlemen ? nay , guiltiness will speak 
Though tongues were out of use .


'Las , what's the matter ? what's the matter , husband ?

Cassio hath here been set on in the dark 
By Roderigo and fellows that are 'scap'd :
He's almost slain , and Roderigo dead .

Alas , good gentleman ; alas , good Cassio !

This is the fruit of whoring . Prithee , Emilia ,
Go know of Cassio where he supp'd to-night .
What , do you shake at that ?

He supp'd at my house ; but I therefore shake not .

O , did he so ? I charge you , go with me .

Fie , fie upon thee , strumpet !

I am no strumpet , but of life as honest 
As you that thus abuse me .

As I , foh , fie upon thee !

Kind gentlemen , let's go see poor Cassio dress'd .
Come , mistress , you must tell 's another tale .
Emilia , run you to the citadel ,
And tell my lord and lady what hath happ'd .
Will you go on afore ?

This is the night 
That either makes me or fordoes me quite .


It is the cause , it is the cause , my soul ;
Let me not name it to you , you chaste stars !
It is the cause . Yet I'll not shed her blood ,
Nor scar that whiter skin of hers than snow ,
And smooth as monumental alabaster .
Yet she must die , else she'll betray more men .
Put out the light , and then put out the light :
If I quench thee , thou flaming minister ,
I can again thy former light restore ,
Should I repent me ; but once put out thy light ,
Thou cunning'st pattern of excelling nature ,
I know not where is that Promethean heat 
That can thy light relume . When I have pluck'd the rose ,
I cannot give it vital growth again ,
It needs must wither : I'll smell it on the tree .

O balmy breath , that dost almost persuade 
Justice to break her sword , One more , one more .
Be thus when thou art dead , and I will kill thee ,
And love thee after . One more , and this the last :
So sweet was ne'er so fatal . I must weep ,
But they are cruel tears ; this sorrow's heavenly ,
It strikes where it doth love . She wakes .

Who's there ? Othello ?

Ay , Desdemona .

Will you come to bed , my lord ?

Have you pray'd to-night , Desdemona ?

Ay , my lord .

If you bethink yourself of any crime 
Unreconcil'd as yet to heaven and grace ,
Solicit for it straight .

Alas , my lord , what may you mean by that ?

Well , do it , and be brief ; I will walk by :
I would not kill thy unprepared spirit ;
No ; heaven forfend , I would not kill thy soul .

Talk you of killing ?

Ay , I do .

Then heaven 
Have mercy on me !

Amen , with all my heart .

If you say so , I hope you will not kill me .

Hum !

And yet I fear you ; for you are fatal then 
When your eyes roll so . Why I should fear I know not ,
Since guiltiness I know not ; but yet I feel I fear .

Think on thy sins .

They are loves I bear to you .

Ay , and for that thou diest .

That death's unnatural that kills for loving .
Alas , why gnaw you so your nether lip ?
Some bloody passion shakes your very frame ;
These are portents , but yet , I hope , I hope 
They do not point on me .

Peace , and be still !

I will so . What's the matter ?

That handkerchief which I so lov'd and gave thee 
Thou gav'st to Cassio .

No , by my life and soul !
Send for the man and ask him .

Sweet soul , take heed ,
Take heed of perjury ; thou'rt on thy death-bed .

Ay , but not yet to die .

Yes , presently ;
Therefore confess thee freely of thy sin ;
For to deny each article with oath 
Cannot remove nor choke the strong conception 
That I do groan withal . Thou art to die .

Then Lord have mercy on me !

I say , amen .

And have you mercy too , I never did 
Offend you in my life ; never lov'd Cassio 
But with such general warranty of heaven 
As I might love ; I never gave him token .

By heaven , I saw my handkerchief in 's hand .
O perjur'd woman , thou dost stone my heart ,
And mak'st me call what I intend to do 
A murder , which I thought a sacrifice :
I saw the handkerchief .

He found it then ;
I never gave it him . Send for him hither ;
Let him confess a truth .

He hath confess'd .

What , my lord ?

That he hath us'd thee .

How ? unlawfully ?

Ay .

He will not say so .

No ; his mouth is stopp'd :
Honest Iago hath ta'en order for 't .

O , my fear interprets . What , is he dead ?

Had all his hairs been lives , my great revenge 
Had stomach for them all .

Alas , he is betray'd and I undone .

Out , strumpet , Weep'st thou for him to my face ?

O , banish me , my lord , but kill me not !

Down , strumpet !

Kill me to-morrow ; let me live to-night !

Nay , if you strive ,

But half an hour !

Being done , there is no pause .

But while I say one prayer !

It is too late .


My lord , my lord , what , ho , my lord , my lord !

What noise is this ? Not dead ? not yet quite dead ?
I that am cruel am yet merciful ;
I would not have thee linger in thy pain .
So , so .

What , ho , my lord , my lord !

Who's there ?

O , good my lord , I would speak a word with you !

Yes ; 'tis Emilia : by and by . She's dead .
'Tis like she comes to speak of Cassio's death ;
The noise was high . Ha , no more moving ?
Still as the grave . Shall she come in ? Were 't good ?
I think she stirs again : no . What's best to do ?
If she come in she'll sure speak to my wife :
My wife , my wife , what wife ? I have no wife :
O , insupportable , O heavy hour !
Methinks it should be now a huge eclipse 
Of sun and moon , and that the affrighted globe 
Should yawn at alteration .

I do beseech you 
That I may speak with you , O , good my lord .

I had forgot thee : O , come in , Emilia :
Soft , by and by : let me the curtains draw .
Where art thou ?


What's the matter with thee now ?

O , my good lord , yonder's foul murder done .

What , now ?

But now , my lord .

It is the very error of the moon ;
She comes more near the earth than she was wont ,
And makes men mad .

Cassio , my lord , has kill'd a young Venetian 
Call'd Roderigo .

Roderigo kill'd !
And Cassio kill'd ?

No , Cassio is not kill'd .

Not Cassio kill'd , then murder's out of tune ,
And sweet revenge grows harsh .

O , falsely , falsely murder'd .

Alas , what cry is that ?

That , what ?

Out , and alas , that was my lady's voice :
Help , Help , ho , help , O lady , speak again !
Sweet Desdemona , O , sweet mistress , speak .

A guiltless death I die .

O , who hath done this deed ?

Nobody ; I myself ; farewell :
Commend me to my kind lord . O , farewell !


Why , how should she be murder'd ?

Alas , who knows ?

You heard her say herself it was not I .

She said so ; I must needs report the truth .

She's like a liar gone to burning hell ;
'Twas I that kill'd her .

O , the more angel she ,
And you the blacker devil .

She turn'd to folly , and she was a whore .

Thou dost belie her , and thou art a devil .

She was false as water .

Thou art rash as fire to say 
That she was false : O , she was heavenly true .

Cassio did tup her ; ask thy husband else .
O , I were damn'd beneath all depth in bell 
But that I did proceed upon just grounds 
To this extremity . Thy husband knew it all .

My husband !

Thy husband .

That she was false to wedlock ?

Ay , with Cassio . Nay , had she been true ,
If heaven would make me such another world 
Of one entire and perfect chrysolite ,
I'd not have sold her for it .

My husband !

Ay , 'twas he that told me first :
An honest man he is , and hates the slime 
That sticks on filthy deeds .

My husband !

What needs this iterance , woman ? I say thy husband .

O mistress , villany hath made mocks with love .
My husband say that she was false !

He , woman ;
I say , thy husband : dost understand the word ?
My friend , thy husband , honest , honest Iago .

If he say so , may his pernicious soul 
Rot half a grain a day , he lies to the heart :
She was too fond of her most filthy bargain .

Ha !

Do thy worst :
This deed of thine is no more worthy heaven 
Than thou wast worthy her .

Peace , you were best .

Thou hast not half the power to do me harm 
As I have to be hurt . O gull , O dolt !
As ignorant as dirt , thou hast done a deed ,
I care not for thy sword ; I'll make thee known ,
Though I lost twenty lives . Help , help , ho , help !
The Moor has kill'd my mistress , Murder , murder !


What is the matter ? How now , general !

O , are you come , Iago ? you have done well ,
That men must lay their murders on your neck .

What is the matter ?

Disprove this villain if thou be'st a man :
He says thou told'st him that his wife was false .
I know thou didst not , thou'rt not such a villain ,
Speak , for my heart is full .

I told him what I thought , and told no more 
Than what he found himself was apt and true .

But did you ever tell him she was false ?

I did .

You told a lie , an odious damned lie ;
Upon my soul , a lie , a wicked lie .
She false with Cassio , Did you say with Cassio ?

With Cassio , mistress . Go to , charm your tongue .

I will not charm my tongue ; I am bound to speak .
My mistress here lies murder'd in her bed .

O heavens forfend !

And your reports have set the murder on .

Nay , stare not , masters ; it is true , indeed .

'Tis a strange truth .

O monstrous act !

Villany , villany , villany !
I think upon 't , I think , I smell 't ; O villany !
I thought so then ; I'll kill myself for grief .
O , villany , villany !

What , are you mad ? I charge you , get you home .

Good gentlemen , let me have leave to speak :
'Tis proper I obey him , but not now .
Perchance , Iago , I will ne'er go home .

O , O , O !


Nay , lay thee down and roar ,
For thou hast kill'd the sweetest innocent 
That e'er did lift up eye .

O , she was foul .
I scarce did know you , uncle . There lies your niece ,
Whose breath , indeed , these hands have newly stopp'd :
I know this act shows terrible and grim .

Poor Desdemona , I am glad thy father's dead .
Thy match was mortal to him , and pure grief 
Shore his old thread in twain : did he live now ,
This sight would make him do a desperate turn ,
Yea , curse his better angel from his side ,
And fall to reprobation .

'Tis pitiful ; but yet Iago knows 
That she with Cassio hath the act of shame 
A thousand times committed ; Cassio confess'd it :
And she did gratify his amorous works 
With that recognizance and pledge of love 
Which I first gave her . I saw it in his hand :
It was a handkerchief , an antique token 
My father gave my mother .

O heaven , O heavenly powers !

Come , hold your peace .

'Twill out , 'twill out ; I hold my peace , air ? no ;
No , I will speak as liberal as the north ;
Let heaven and men and devils , let them all ,
All , all , cry shame against me , yet I'll speak .

Be wise , and get you home .

I will not .


Fie !
Your sword upon a woman ?

O thou dull Moor , that handkerchief thou speak'st of 
I found by fortune and did give my husband ;
For often , with a solemn earnestness ,
More than , indeed , belong'd to such a trifle ,
He begg'd of me to steal it .

Villanous whore !

She give it Cassio , no , alas , I found it ,
And I did give 't my husband .

Filth , thou liest !

By heaven , I do not , I do not , gentlemen .
O murderous coxcomb , what should such a fool 
Do with so good a wife ?

Are there no stones in heaven 
But what serve for the thunder ? Precious villain !


The woman falls : sure , he has kill'd his wife .

Ay , ay ; O , lay me by my mistress' side .

He's gone ; but his wife's kill'd .

'Tis a notorious villain . Take you this weapon ,
Which I have here recover'd from the Moor .
Come , guard the door without ; let him not pass ,
But kill him rather . I'll after that same villain ,
For 'tis a damned slave .


I am not valiant neither ,
But every puny whipster gets my sword .
But why should honour outlive honesty ?
Let it go all .

What did thy song bode , lady ?
Hark , canst thou hear me ? I will play the swan ,
And die in music :
Willow , willow , willow .
Moor , she was chaste ; she lov'd thee , cruel Moor ;
So come my soul to bliss as I speak true ;
So speaking as I think , I die , I die .


I have another weapon in this chamber ;
It is a sword of Spain , the ice brook's temper .
O , here it is . Uncle , I must come forth .

If thou attempt it , it will cost thee dear :
Thou hast no weapon , and perforce must suffer .

Look in upon me then , and speak with me ,
Or , naked as I am , I will assault thee .


What is the matter ?

Behold , I have a weapon ;
A better never did itself sustain 
Upon a soldier's thigh : I have seen the day ,
That with this little arm , and this good sword ,
I have made my way through more impediments 
Than twenty times your stop : but , O vain boast !
Who can control his fate ? 'tis not so now .
Be not afraid , though you do see me weapon'd ;
Here is my journey's end , here is my butt ,
And very sea-mark of my utmost sail .
Do you go back dismay'd ? 'tis a lost fear ;
Man but a rush against Othello's breast ,
And he retires . Where should Othello go ?
Now how dost thou look now ? O ill-starr'd wench !
Pale as thy smock , when we shall meet at compt ,
This look of thine will hurl my soul from heaven ,
And fiends will snatch at it . Cold , cold , my girl !
Even like thy chastity .
O , cursed , cursed slave . Whip me , ye devils ,
From the possession of this heavenly sight !
Blow me about in winds , roast me in sulphur !
Wash me in steep-down gulfs of liquid fire !
O Desdemona , Desdemona , dead !
Oh , Oh , Oh !


Where is this rash and most unfortunate man ?

That's he that was Othello ; here I am .

Where is that viper ? bring the villain forth .

I look down towards his feet ; but that's a fable .
If that thou be'st a devil , I cannot kill thee .


Wrench his sword from him .

I bleed , sir ; but not kill'd .

I am not sorry neither ; I'd have thee live ;
For , in my sense , 'tis happiness to die .

O thou Othello , that wert once so good ,
Fall'n in the practice of a damned slave ,
What shall be said to thee ?

Why , any thing :
An honourable murderer , if you will ;
For nought did I in hate , but all in honour .

This wretch hath part confess'd his villany :
Did you and he consent in Cassio's death ?

Ay .

Dear general , I never gave you cause .

I do believe it , and I ask your pardon .
Will you , I pray , demand that demi-devil 
Why he hath thus ensnar'd my soul and body ?

Demand me nothing : what you know , you know :
From this time forth I never will speak word .

What , not to pray ?

Torments will ope your lips .

Well , thou dost best .

Sir , you shall understand what hath befall'n ,
Which , as I think , you know not . Here is a letter 
Found in the pocket of the slain Roderigo ,
And here another ; the one of them imports 
The death of Cassio to be undertook 
By Roderigo .

O villain !

Most heathenish and most gross !

Now here's another discontented paper ,
Found in his pocket too ; and this , it seems ,
Roderigo meant to have sent this damned villain ,
But that , belike , Iago in the interim 
Came in and satisfied him .

O the pernicious caitiff !
How came you , Cassio , by that handkerchief 
That was my wife's ?

I found it in my chamber ;
And he himself confess'd but even now 
That there he dropp'd it for a special purpose 
Which wrought to his desire .

O fool , fool , fool !

There is besides in Roderigo's letter 
How he upbraids Iago that he made him 
Brave me upon the watch ; whereon it came 
That I was cast : and even but now he spake ,
After long seeming dead , Iago hurt him ,
Iago set him on .

You must forsake this room and go with us ;
Your power and your command is taken off ,
And Cassio rules in Cyprus . For this slave ,
If there be any cunning cruelty 
That can torment him much and hold him long ,
It shall be his . You shall close prisoner rest .
Till that the nature of your fault be known 
To the Venetian state . Come , bring him away .

Soft you ; a word or two before you go .
I have done the state some service , and they know't ;
No more of that . I pray you , in your letters ,
When you shall these unlucky deeds relate ,
Speak of me as I am ; nothing extenuate ,
Nor set down aught in malice : then , must you speak 
Of one that lov'd not wisely but too well ;
Of one not easily jealous , but , being wrought ,
Perplex'd in the extreme ; of one whose hand ,
Like the base Indian , threw a pearl away 
Richer than all his tribe ; of one whose subdu'd eyes 
Albeit unused to the melting mood ,
Drop tears as fast as the Arabian trees 
Their med'cinable gum . Set you down this ;
And say besides , that in Aleppo once ,
Where a malignant and a turban'd Turk 
Beat a Venetian and traduc'd the state ,
I took by the throat the circumcised dog ,
And smote him thus .


O bloody period !

All that's spoke is marr'd .

I kiss'd thee ere I kill'd thee ; no way but this ,

Killing myself to die upon a kiss .


This did I fear , but thought he had no weapon ;
For he was great of heart .

O Spartan dog !
More fell than anguish , hunger , or the sea .
Look on the tragic loading of this bed ;
This is thy work ; the object poisons sight ;
Let it be hid . Gratiano , keep the house ,
And seize upon the fortunes of the Moor ,
For they succeed on you . To you , lord governor ,
Remains the censure of this hellish villain ,
The time , the place , the torture ; O , enforce it .
Myself will straight aboard , and to the state 
This heavy act with heavy heart relate .

ROMEO AND JULIET

Two households , both alike in dignity ,
In fair Verona , where we lay our scene ,
From ancient grudge break to new mutiny ,
Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean .
From forth the fatal loins of these two foes 
A pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life ;
Whose misadventur'd piteous overthrows 
Do with their death bury their parents' strife .
The fearful passage of their death-mark'd love ,
And the continuance of their parents' rage ,
Which , but their children's end , nought could remove ,
Is now the two hours' traffick of our stage ;
The which if you with patient ears attend ,
What here shall miss , our toil shall strive to mend .

Gregory , o' my word , we'll not carry coals .

No . for then we should be colliers .

I mean , an we be in choler , we'll draw .

Ay , while you live , draw your neck out o' the collar .

I strike quickly , being moved .

But thou art not quickly moved to strike .

A dog of the house of Montague moves me .

To move is to stir , and to be valiant is to stand ; therefore , if thou art moved , thou runnest away .

A dog of that house shall move me to stand : I will take the wall of any man or maid of Montague's .

That shows thee a weak slave ; for the weakest goes to the wall .

'Tis true ; and therefore women , being the weaker vessels , are ever thrust to the wall : therefore I will push Montague's men from the wall , and thrust his maids to the wall .

The quarrel is between our masters and us their men .

'Tis all one , I will show myself a tyrant : when I have fought with the men , I will be cruel with the maids ; I will cut off their heads .

The heads of the maids ?

Ay , the heads of the maids , or their maidenheads ; take it in what sense thou wilt .

They must take it in sense that feel it .

Me they shall feel while I am able to stand ; and 'tis known I am a pretty piece of flesh .

'Tis well thou art not fish ; if thou hadst , thou hadst been poor John . Draw thy tool ; here comes two of the house of the Montagues .


My naked weapon is out ; quarrel , I will back thee .

How , turn thy back and run ?

Fear me not .

No , marry ; I fear thee !

Let us take the law of our sides ; let them begin .

I will frown as I pass by , and let them take it as they list .

Nay , as they dare . I will bite my thumb at them ; which is a disgrace to them , if they bear it .

Do you bite your thumb at us , sir ?

I do bite my thumb , sir .

Do you bite your thumb at us , sir ?

Is the law of our side if I say ay ?

No .

No , sir , I do not bite my thumb at you , sir ; but I bite my thumb , sir .

Do you quarrel , sir ?

Quarrel , sir , no , sir .

If you do , sir , I am for you : I serve as good a man as you .

No better .

Well , sir .

Say , 'better ;' here comes one of my master's kinsmen .

Yes , better , sir .

You lie .

Draw , if you be men . Gregory , remember thy swashing blow .

Part , fools !
Put up your swords ; you know not what you do .

What , art thou drawn among these heartless hinds ?
Turn-thee , Benvolio , look upon thy death .

I do but keep the peace : put up thy sword ,
Or manage it to part these men with me .

What , drawn , and talk of peace ? I hate the word ,
As I hate hell , all Montagues , and thee .
Have at thee , coward !


Clubs , bills , and partisans , strike , beat them down !
Down with the Capulets , down with the Montagues !


What noise is this ? Give me my long sword , ho !

A crutch , a crutch , Why call you for a sword ?

My sword , I say , Old Montague is come ,
And flourishes his blade in spite of me .


Thou villain Capulet , Hold me not ; let me go .

Thou shalt not stir one foot to seek a foe .


Rebellious subjects , enemies to peace ,
Profaners of this neighbour-stained steel ,
Will they not hear ? What ho , you men , you beasts ,
That quench the fire of your pernicious rage 
With purple fountains issuing from your veins ,
On pain of torture , from those bloody hands 
Throw your mis-temper'd weapons to the ground ,
And hear the sentence of your moved prince .
Three civil brawls , bred of an airy word ,
By thee , old Capulet , and Montague ,
Have thrice disturb'd the quiet of our streets ,
And made Verona's ancient citizens 
Cast by their grave beseeming ornaments ,
To wield old partisans , in hands as old ,
Canker'd with peace , to part your canker'd hate .
If ever you disturb our streets again 
Your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace .
For this time , all the rest depart away :
You , Capulet , shall go along with me ;
And , Montague , come you this afternoon 
To know our further pleasure in this case ,
To old Free-town , our common judgment-place .
Once more , on pain of death , all men depart .


Who set this ancient quarrel new a-broach ?
Speak , nephew , were you by when it began ?

Here were the servants of your adversary 
And yours close fighting ere I did approach :
I drew to part them ; in the instant came 
The fiery Tybalt , with his sword prepar'd ,
Which , as he breath'd defiance to my ears ,
He swung about his head , and cut the winds ,
Who , nothing hurt withal hiss'd him in scorn .
While we were interchanging thrusts and blows ,
Came more and more , and fought on part and part ,
Till the prince came , who parted either part .

O , where is Romeo ? saw you him to-day ?
Right glad I am he was not at this fray .

Madam , an hour before the worshipp'd sun 
Peer'd forth the golden window of the east ,
A troubled mind drave me to walk abroad ;
Where , underneath the grove of sycamore 
That westward rooteth from the city's side ,
So early walking did I see your son :
Towards him I made ; but he was ware of me ,
And stole into the covert of the wood :
I , measuring his affections by my own ,
That most are busied when they're most alone ,
Pursu'd my humour not pursuing his ,
And gladly shunn'd who gladly fled from me .

Many a morning hath he there been seen ,
With tears augmenting the fresh morning's dew ,
Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs :
But all so soon as the all-cheering sun 
Should in the furthest east begin to draw 
The shady curtains from Aurora's bed ,
Away from light steals home my heavy son ,
And private in his chamber pens himself ,
Shuts up his windows , locks fair daylight out ,
And makes himself an artificial night .
Black and portentous must this humour prove 
Unless good-counsel may the cause remove .

My noble uncle , do you know the cause ?

I neither know it nor can learn of him .

Have you importun'd him by any means ?

Both by myself and many other friends :
But he , his own affections' counsellor ,
Is to himself , I will not say how true ,
But to himself so secret and so close ,
So far from sounding and discovery ,
As is the bud bit with an envious worm ,
Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air ,
Or dedicate his beauty to the sun .
Could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow ,
We would as willingly give cure as know .

See where he comes : so please you , step aside ;
I'll know his grievance , or be much denied .

I would thou wert so happy by thy stay ,
To hear true shrift . Come , madam , let's away .

Good morrow , cousin .

Is the day so young ?

But new struck nine .

Ay me , sad hours seem long .
Was that my father that went hence so fast ?

It was . What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours ?

Not having that , which having , makes them short .

In love ?

Out 

Of love ?

Out of her favour , where I am in love .

Alas , that love , so gentle in his view ,
Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof .

Alas , that love , whose view is muffled still ,
Should , without eyes , see pathways to his will .
Where shall we dine ? O me , What fray was here ?
Yet tell me not , for I have heard it all .
Here's much to do with hate , but more with love :
Why then , O brawling love , O loving hate !
O any thing , of nothing first create .
O heavy lightness , serious vanity !
Mis-shapen chaos of well-seeming forms !
Feather of lead , bright smoke , cold fire , sick health !
Still-waking sleep , that is not what it is !
This love feel I , that feel no love in this .
Dost thou not laugh ?

No , coz , I rather weep .

Good heart , at what ?

At thy good heart's oppression .

Why , such is love's transgression .
Griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast ,
Which thou wilt propagate to have it press'd 
With more of thine : this love that thou hast shown 
Doth add more grief to too much of mine own .
Love is a smoke rais'd with the fume of sighs ;
Being purg'd , a fire sparkling in lovers' eyes ;
Being vex'd , a sea nourish'd with lovers' tears :
What is it else ? a madness most discreet ,
A choking gall , and a preserving sweet .
Farewell , my coz .


Soft , I will go along ;
An if you leave me so , you do me wrong .

Tut , I have lost myself ; I am not here ;
This is not Romeo , he's some other where .

Tell me in sadness , who is that you love .

What , shall I groan and tell thee ?

Groan , why , no ;
But sadly tell me who .

Bid a sick man in sadness make his will ;
Ah , word ill urg'd to one that is so ill .
In sadness , cousin , I do love a woman .

I aim'd so near when I suppos'd you lov'd .

A right good mark-man , And she's fair I love .

A right fair mark , fair coz , is soonest hit .

Well , in that hit you miss : she'll not be hit 
With Cupid's arrow ; she hath Dian's wit ;
And , in strong proof of chastity well arm'd ,
From love's weak childish bow she lives unharm'd .
She will not stay the siege of loving terms ,
Nor bide the encounter of assailing eyes ,
Nor ope her lap to saint-seducing gold :
O , she is rich in beauty ; only poor 
That , when she dies , with beauty dies her store .

Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste ?

She hath , and in that sparing makes huge waste ;
For beauty , starv'd with her severity ,
Cuts beauty off from all posterity .
She is too fair , too wise , wisely too fair ,
To merit bliss by making me despair :
She hath forsworn to love , and in that vow 
Do I live dead that live to tell it now .

Be rul'd by me ; forget to think of her .

O , teach me how I should forget to think .

By giving liberty unto thine eyes :
Examine other beauties .

'Tis the way 
To call hers exquisite , in question more .
These happy masks that kiss fair ladies' brows 
Being black put us in mind they hide the fair ;
He , that is strucken blind cannot forget 
The precious treasure of his eyesight lost :
Show me a mistress that is passing fair ,
What doth her beauty serve but as a note 
Where I may read who pass'd that passing fair ?
Farewell : thou canst not teach me to forget .

I'll pay that doctrine , or else die in debt .


But Montague is bound as well as I ,
In penalty alike ; and 'tis not hard , I think ,
For men so old as we to keep the peace .

Of honourable reckoning are you both ;
And pity 'tis you liv'd at odds so long .
But now , my lord , what say you to my suit ?

But saying o'er what I have said before :
My child is yet a stranger in the world ,
She hath not seen the change of fourteen years ;
Let two more summers wither in their pride 
Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride .

Younger than she are happy mothers made .

And too soon marr'd are those so early made .
Earth hath swallow'd all my hopes but she ,
She is the hopeful lady of my earth :
But woo her , gentle Paris , get her heart ,
My will to her consent is but a part ;
An she agree , within her scope of choice 
Lies my consent and fair according voice .
This night I hold an old accustom'd feast ,
Whereto I have invited many a guest 
Such as I love ; and you , among the store ,
One more , most welcome , makes my number more .
At my poor house look to behold this night 
Earth-treading stars that make dark heaven light :
Such comfort as do lusty young men feel 
When well-apparel'd April on the heel 
Of limping winter treads , even such delight 
Among fresh female buds shall you this night 
Inherit at my house ; hear all , all see ,
And like her most whose merit most shall be :
Which on more view , of many mine being one 
May stand in number , though in reckoning none .
Come , go with me .

Go , sirrah , trudge about 
Through fair Verona ; find those persons out 
Whose names are written there , and to them say ,
My house and welcome on their pleasure stay .


Find them out whose names are written here , It is written that the shoemaker should meddle with his yard , and the tailor with his last , the fisher with his pencil , and the painter with his nets ; but I am sent to find those persons , whose names are here writ , and can never find what names the writing person hath here writ . I must to the learned . In good time .


Tut , man , one fire burns out another's burning ,
One pain is lessen'd by another's anguish ;
Turn giddy , and be holp by backward turning ;
One desperate grief cures with another's languish :
Take thou some new infection to thy eye ,
And the rank poison of the old will die .

Your plantain leaf is excellent for that .

For what , I pray thee ?

For your broken shin .

Why , Romeo , art thou mad ?

Not mad , but bound more than a madman is ;
Shut up in prison , kept without my food ,
Whipp'd and tormented , and Good den , good fellow .

God gi' good den . I pray , sir , can you read ?

Ay , mine own fortune in my misery .

Perhaps you have learn'd it without book : but , I pray , can you read any thing you see ?

Ay , if I know the letters and the language .

Ye say honestly ; rest you merry !


Stay , fellow ; I can read .
Signior Martino and his wife and daughters ; County Anselme and his beauteous sisters ; the lady widow of Vitruvio ; Signior Placentio , and his lovely nieces ; Mercutio and his brother Valentine ; mine uncle Capulet , his wife and daughters ; my fair niece Rosaline ; Livia ; Signior Valentio and his cousin Tybalt ; Lucio and the lively Helena .
A fair assembly : whither should they come ?

Up .

Whither ?

To supper ; to our house .

Whose house ?

My master's .

Indeed , I should have asked you that before .

Now I'll tell you without asking . My master is the great rich Capulet ; and if you be not of the house of Montagues , I pray , come and crush a cup of wine . Rest you merry !


At this same ancient feast of Capulet's ,
Sups the fair Rosaline , whom thou so lov'st ,
With all the admired beauties of Verona :
Go thither ; and , with unattainted eye 
Compare her face with some that I shall show ,
And I will make thee think thy swan a crow .

When the devout religion of mine eye 
Maintains such falsehood , then turn tears to fires !
And these , who often drown'd could never die ,
Transparent heretics , be burnt for liars !
One fairer than my love , the all-seeing sun 
Ne'er saw her match since first the world begun .

Tut , you saw her fair , none else being by ,
Herself pois'd with herself in either eye ;
But in that crystal scales let there be weigh'd 
Your lady's love against some other maid 
That I will show you shining at this feast ,
And she shall scant show well that now shows best .

I'll go along , no such sight to be shown ,
But to rejoice in splendour of mine own .


Nurse , where's my daughter ? call her forth to me .

Now , by my maidenhead , at twelve year old ,
I bade her come . What , lamb , what , ladybird !
God forbid , where's this girl ? what , Juliet !


How now , who calls ?

Your mother .

Madam , I am here .
What is your will ?

This is the matter . Nurse , give leave awhile .
We must talk in secret : nurse , come back again ;
I have remember'd me , thou's hear our counsel .
Thou know'st my daughter's of a pretty age .

Faith , I can tell her age unto an hour .

She's not fourteen .

I'll lay fourteen of my teeth 
And yet to my teen be it spoken I have but four 
She is not fourteen . How long is it now 
To Lammas-tide ?

A fortnight and odd days .

Even or odd , of all days in the year ,
Come Lammas-eve at night shall she be fourteen .
Susan and she God rest all Christian souls !
Were of an age . Well , Susan is with God ;
She was too good for me . But , as I said ,
On Lammas-eve at night shall she be fourteen ;
That shall she , marry ; I remember it well .
'Tis since the earthquake now eleven years ;
And she was wean'd , I never shall forget it ,
Of all the days of the year , upon that day ;
For I had then laid wormwood to my dug ,
Sitting in the sun under the dove-house wall ;
My lord and you were then at Mantua .
Nay , I do bear a brain :but , as I said ,
When it did taste the wormwood on the nipple 
Of my dug and felt it bitter , pretty fool !
To see it tetchy and fall out with the dug .
'Shake ,' quoth the dove-house : 'twas no need , I trow ,
To bid me trudge :
And since that time it is eleven years ;
For then she could stand high lone ; nay , by the rood ,
She could have run and waddled all about ;
For even the day before she broke her brow :
And then my husband God be with his soul !
A' was a merry man took up the child :
'Yea ,' quoth he , 'dost thou fall upon thy face ?
Thou wilt fall backward when thou hast more wit ;
Wilt thou not , Jule ?' and , by my halidom ,
The pretty wretch left crying , and said 'Ay .' 
To see now how a jest shall come about !
I warrant , an I should live a thousand years ,
I never should forget it : 'Wilt thou not , Jule ?' quoth he ;
And , pretty fool , it stinted and said 'Ay .' 

Enough of this ; I pray thee , hold thy peace .

Yes , madam . Yet I cannot choose but laugh ,
To think it should leave crying , and say 'Ay .' 
And yet , I warrant , it had upon its brow 
A bump as big as a young cockerel's stone ;
A parlous knock ; and it cried bitterly :
'Yea ,' quoth my husband , 'fall'st upon thy face ?
Thou wilt fall backward when thou com'st to age ;
Wilt thou not , Jule ?' it stinted and said 'Ay .' 

And stint thou too , I pray thee , nurse , say I .

Peace , I have done . God mark thee to his grace !
Thou wast the prettiest babe that e'er I nursed :
An I might live to see thee married once ,
I have my wish .

Marry , that 'marry' is the very theme 
I came to talk of . Tell me , daughter Juliet ,
How stands your disposition to be married ?

It is an honour that I dream not of .

An honour , were not I thine only nurse ,
I would say thou hadst suck'd wisdom from thy teat .

Well , think of marriage now ; younger than you ,
Here in Verona , ladies of esteem ,
Are made already mothers : by my count ,
I was your mother much upon these years 
That you are now a maid . Thus then in brief ,
The valiant Paris seeks you for his love .

A man , young lady , lady , such a man 
As all the world why , he's a man of wax .

Verona's summer hath not such a flower .

Nay , he's a flower ; in faith , a very flower .

What say you ? can you love the gentleman ?
This night you shall behold him at our feast ;
Read o'er the volume of young Paris' face 
And find delight writ there with beauty's pen ;
Examine every married lineament ,
And see how one another lends content ;
And what obscur'd in this fair volume lies 
Find written in the margent of his eyes .
This precious book of love , this unbound lover ,
To beautify him , only lacks a cover :
The fish lives in the sea , and 'tis much pride 
For fair without the fair within to hide :
That book in many eyes doth share the glory ,
That in gold clasps locks in the golden story :
So shall you share all that he doth possess ,
By having him making yourself no less .

No less , nay , bigger ; women grow by men .

Speak briefly , can you like of Paris' love ?

I'll look to like , if looking liking move ;
But no more deep will I endart mine eye 
Than your consent gives strength to make it fly .


Madam , the guests are come , supper served up , you called , my young lady asked for , the nurse cursed in the pantry , and everything in extremity . I must hence to wait ; I beseech you , follow straight .

We follow thee . Juliet , the county stays .

Go , girl , seek happy nights to happy days .


What , shall this speech be spoke for our excuse ,
Or shall we on without apology ?

The date is out of such prolixity :
We'll have no Cupid hood-wink'd with a scarf ,
Bearing a Tartar's painted bow of lath ,
Scaring the ladies like a crow-keeper ;
Nor no without-book prologue , faintly spoke 
After the prompter , for our entrance :
But , let them measure us by what they will ,
We'll measure them a measure , and be gone .

Give me a torch : I am not for this ambling ;
Being but heavy , I will bear the light .

Nay , gentle Romeo , we must have you dance .

Not I , believe me : you have dancing shoes 
With nimble soles ; I have a soul of lead 
So stakes me to the ground I cannot move .

You are a lover ; borrow Cupid's wings ,
And soar with them above a common bound .

I am too sore enpierced with his shaft 
To soar with his light feathers ; and so bound 
I cannot bound a pitch above dull woe :
Under love's heavy burden do I sink .

And , to sink in it , should you burden love ;
Too great oppression for a tender thing .

Is love a tender thing ? it is too rough ,
Too rude , too boisterous ; and it pricks like thorn .

If love be rough with you , be rough with love ;
Prick love for pricking , and you beat love down .
Give me a case to put my visage in :

A visor for a visor , what care I ,
What curious eye doth quote deformities ?
Here are the beetle brows shall blush for me .

Come , knock and enter ; and no sooner in ,
But every man betake him to his legs .

A torch for me ; let wantons , light of heart ,
Tickle the senseless rushes with their heels ,
For I am proverb'd with a grandsire phrase ;
I'll be a candle holder , and look on .
The game was ne'er so fair , and I am done .

Tut , dun's the mouse , the constable's own word .
If thou art Dun , we'll draw thee from the mire ,
Of save your reverence love , wherein thou stick'st 
Up to the ears . Come , we burn daylight , ho !

Nay , that's not so .

I mean , sir , in delay 
We waste our lights in vain , like lamps by day .
Take our good meaning , for our judgment sits 
Five times in that ere once in our five wits .

And we mean well in going to this masque ;
But 'tis no wit to go .

Why , may one ask ?

I dream'd a dream to-night .

And so did I .

Well , what was yours ?

That dreamers often lie .

In bed asleep , while they do dream things true .

O , then , I see , Queen Mab hath been with you .

Queen Mab , What's she ?

She is the fairies' midwife , and she comes 
In shape no bigger than an agate-stone 
On the fore-finger of an alderman ,
Drawn with a team of little atomies 
Athwart men's noses as they lie asleep :
Her waggon-spokes made of long spinners' legs ;
The cover , of the wings of grasshoppers ;
The traces , of the smallest spider's web ;
The collars , of the moonshine's watery beams ;
Her whip , of cricket's bone ; the lash , of film ;
Her waggoner , a small grey-coated gnat ,
Not half so big as a round little worm 
Prick'd from the lazy finger of a maid ;
Her chariot is an empty hazel-nut ,
Made by the joiner squirrel or old grub ,
Time out o' mind the fairies' coach-makers .
And in this state she gallops night by night 
Through lovers' brains , and then they dream of love ;
O'er courtiers' knees , that dream on curtsies straight ;
O'er lawyers' fingers , who straight dream on fees ;
O'er ladies' lips , who straight on kisses dream ;
Which oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues ,
Because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are .
Sometimes she gallops o'er a courtier's nose ,
And then dreams he of smelling out a suit ;
And sometimes comes she with a tithe pig's tail ,
Tickling a parson's nose as a' lies asleep ,
Then dreams he of another benefice ;
Sometime she driveth o'er a soldier's neck ,
And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats ,
Of breaches , ambuscadoes , Spanish bladed ,
Of healths five fathom deep ; and then anon 
Drums in his ear , at which he starts and wakes ;
And , being thus frighted , swears a prayer or two ,
And sleeps again . This is that very Mab 
That plats the manes of horses in the night ;
And bakes the elf-locks in foul sluttish hairs ,
Which once untangled much misfortune bodes ;
This is the hag , when maids lie on their backs ,
That presses them and learns them first to bear ,
Making them women of good carriage :
This is she 

Peace , peace , Mercutio , peace !
Thou talk'st of nothing .

True , I talk of dreams ,
Which are the children of an idle brain ,
Begot of nothing but vain fantasy ;
Which is as thin of substance as the air ,
And more inconstant than the wind , who woos 
Even now the frozen bosom of the north ,
And , being anger'd , puffs away from thence ,
Turning his face to the dew-dropping south .

This wind you talk of blows us from ourselves ;
Supper is done , and we shall come too late .

I fear too early ; for my mind misgives 
Some consequence yet hanging in the stars 
Shall bitterly begin his fearful date 
With this night's revels , and expire the term 
Of a despised life clos'd in my breast 
By some vile forfeit of untimely death .
But he , that hath the steerage of my course ,
Direct my sail !, On , lusty gentlemen .

Strike , drum .


Where's Potpan , that he helps not to take away ? he shift a trencher , he scrape a trencher !

When good manners shall lie all in one or two men's hands , and they unwashed too , 'tis a foul thing .

Away with the joint-stools , remove the court-cupboard , look to the plate . Good thou , save me a piece of marchpane ; and , as thou lovest me , let the porter let in Susan Grindstone and Nell . Antony , and Potpan !

Ay , boy ; ready .

You are looked for and called for , asked for and sought for in the great chamber .

We cannot be here and there too .

Cheerly , boys ; be brisk awhile , and the longer liver take all .

Welcome , gentlemen , ladies that have their toes 
Unplagu'd with corns will walk a bout with you .
Ah ha , my mistresses , which of you all 
Will now deny to dance ? she that makes dainty , she ,
I'll swear , hath corns ; am I come near ye now ?
Welcome , gentlemen , I have seen the day 
That I have worn a visor , and could tell 
A whispering tale in a fair lady's ear 
Such as would please ; 'tis gone , 'tis gone , 'tis gone .
You are welcome , gentlemen , Come , musicians , play .
A hall , a hall , give room , and foot it , girls .

More light , ye knaves , and turn the tables up ,
And quench the fire , the room has grown too hot .
Ah , sirrah , this unlook'd-for sport comes well .
Nay , sit , nay , sit , good cousin Capulet ,
For you and I are past our dancing days ;
How long is 't now since last yourself and I 
Were in a mask ?

By'r Lady , thirty years .

What , man , 'tis not so much , 'tis not so much :
'Tis since the nuptial of Lucentio ,
Come Pentecost as quickly as it will ,
Some five and twenty years ; and then we mask'd .

'Tis more , 'tis more ; his son is older , sir .
His son is thirty .

Will you tell me that ?
His son was but a ward two years ago .

What lady is that which doth enrich the hand 
Of yonder knight ?

I know not , sir .

O , she doth teach the torches to burn bright .
It seems she hangs upon the cheek of night 
Like a rich jewel in an Ethiop's ear ;
Beauty too rich for use , for earth too dear !
So shows a snowy dove trooping with crows ,
As yonder lady o'er her fellows shows .
The measure done , I'll watch her place of stand ,
And , touching hers , make blessed my rude hand .
Did my heart love till now ? forswear it , sight !
For I ne'er saw true beauty till this night .

This , by his voice , should be a Montague .
Fetch me my rapier , boy . What , dares the slave 
Come hither , cover'd with an antick face ,
To fleer and scorn at our solemnity ?
Now , by the stock and honour of my kin ,
To strike him dead I hold it not a sin .

Why , how now , kinsman , wherefore storm you so ?

Uncle , this is a Montague , our foe ;
A villain that is hither come in spite ,
To scorn at our solemnity this night .

Young Romeo , is it ?

'Tis he , that villain Romeo .

Content thee , gentle coz , let him alone :
He bears him like a portly gentleman ;
And , to say truth , Verona brags of him 
To be a virtuous and well-govern'd youth .
I would not for the wealth of all this town 
Here in my house do him disparagement ;
Therefore be patient , take no note of him :
It is my will ; the which if thou respect ,
Show a fair presence and put off these frowns ,
An ill-beseeming semblance for a feast .

It fits , when such a villain is a guest :
I'll not endure him .

He shall be endur'd :
What , goodman boy ; I say , he shall , go to ;
Am I the master here , or you ? go to .
You'll not endure him , God shall mend my soul !
You'll make a mutiny among my guests !
You will set cock-a-hoop , you'll be the man !

Why , uncle , 'tis a shame .

Go to , go to ;
You are a saucy boy is't so indeed ?
This trick may chance to scathe you .I know what :
You must contrary me , marry , 'tis time .
Well said , my hearts , You are a princox ; go :
Be quiet , or More light , more light !For shame !
I'll make you quiet . What , cheerly , my hearts !

Patience perforce with wilful choler meeting 
Makes my flesh tremble in their different greeting .
I will withdraw ; but this intrusion shall 
Now seeming sweet convert to bitter gall .


If I profane with my unworthiest hand 
This holy shrine , the gentle sin is this ;
My lips , two blushing pilgrims , ready stand 
To smooth that rough touch with a tenderkiss .

Good pilgrim , you do wrong your hand too much ,
Which mannerly devotion shows in this ;
For saints have hands that pilgrims' hands do touch ,
And palm to palm is holy palmers' kiss .

Have not saints lips , and holy palmers too ?

Ay , pilgrim , lips that they must use in prayer .

O , then , dear saint , let lips do what hands do ;
They pray , grant thou , lest faith turn to despair .

Saints do not move , though grant for prayers' sake .

Then move not , while my prayers' effect I take .
Thus from my lips , by thine , my sin is purg'd .


Then have my lips the sin that they have took .

Sin from my lips ? O trespass sweetly urg'd !
Give me my sin again .

You kiss by the book .

Madam , your mother craves a word with you .

What is her mother ?

Marry , bachelor ,
Her mother is the lady of the house ,
And a good lady , and a wise , and virtuous :
I nurs'd her daughter , that you talk'd withal ;
I tell you he that can lay hold of her 
Shall have the chinks .

Is she a Capulet ?
O dear account , my life is my foe's debt .

Away , be gone ; the sport is at the best .

Ay , so I fear ; the more is my unrest .

Nay , gentlemen , prepare not to be gone ;
We have a trifling foolish banquet towards .
Is it e'en so ? Why then , I thank you all ;
I thank you , honest gentlemen ; good-night .
More torches here , Come on then , let's to bed .
Ah , sirrah , by my fay , it waxes late ;
I'll to my rest .


Come hither , nurse . What is yond gentleman ?

The son and heir of old Tiberio .

What's he that now is going out of door ?

Marry , that , I think , be young Petruchio .

What's he , that follows there , that would not dance ?

I know not .

Go , ask his name .If he be married ,
My grave is like to be my wedding bed .

His name is Romeo , and a Montague ;
The only son of your great enemy .

My only love sprung from my only hate !
Too early seen unknown , and known too late !
Prodigious birth of love it is to me ,
That I must love a loathed enemy .

What's this , what's this ?

A rime I learn'd even now 
Of one I danc'd withal .


Anon , anon !
Come , let's away ; the strangers are all gone .

Now old desire doth in his death-bed lie ,
And young affection gapes to be his heir ;
That fair for which love groan'd for and would die ,
With tender Juliet match'd , is now not fair .
Now Romeo is belov'd and loves again ,
Alike bewitched by the charm of looks ,
But to his foe suppos'd he must complain ,
And she steal love's sweet bait from fearful hooks :
Being held a foe , he may not have access 
To breathe such vows as lovers us'd to swear ;
And she as much in love , her means much less 
To meet her new-beloved any where :
But passion lends them power , time means , to meet ,
Tempering extremity with extreme sweet .

Can I go forward when my heart is here ?
Turn back , dull earth , and find thy centre out .

Romeo , my cousin Romeo !

He is wise ;
And , on my life , hath stol'n him home to bed .

He ran this way , and leap'd this orchard wall :
Call , good Mercutio .

Nay , I'll conjure too .
Romeo , humours , madman , passion , lover !
Appear thou in the likeness of a sigh :
Speak but one rime and I am satisfied ;
Cry but 'Ay me !' couple but 'love' and 'dove ;' 
Speak to my gossip Venus one fair word .
One nickname for her purblind son and heir ,
Young Adam Cupid , he that shot so trim 
When King Cophetua lov'd the beggar-maid .
He heareth not , he stirreth not , he moveth not ;
The ape is dead , and I must conjure him .
I conjure thee by Rosaline's bright eyes ,
By her high forehead , and her scarlet lip ,
By her fine foot , straight leg , and quivering thigh ,
And the demesnes that there adjacent lie ,
That in thy likeness thou appear to us .

An if he hear thee , thou wilt anger him .

This cannot anger him : 'twould anger him 
To raise a spirit in his mistress' circle 
Of some strange nature , letting it there stand 
Till she had laid it , and conjur'd it down ;
That were some spite : my invocation 
Is fair and honest , and in his mistress' name 
I conjure only but to raise up him .

Come , he hath hid himself among these trees ,
To be consorted with the humorous night :
Blind is his love and best befits the dark .

If love be blind , love cannot hit the mark .
Now will he sit under a medlar tree ,
And wish his mistress were that kind of fruit 
As maids call medlars , when they laugh alone .
O Romeo , that she were , O , that she were 
An open et c tera , thou a poperin pear .
Romeo , good night : I'll to my truckle-bed ;
This field-bed is too cold for me to sleep :
Come , shall we go ?

Go , then ; for 'tis in vain 
To seek him here that means not to be found .


He jests at scars , that never felt a wound .

But , soft , what light through yonder window breaks ?
It is the east , and Juliet is the sun !
Arise , fair sun , and kill the envious moon ,
Who is already sick and pale with grief ,
That thou her maid art far more fair than she :
Be not her maid , since she is envious ;
Her vestal livery is but sick and green ,
And none but fools do wear it ; cast it off .
It is my lady ; O , it is my love :
O , that she knew she were .
She speaks , yet she says nothing : what of that ?
Her eye discourses ; I will answer it .
I am too bold , 'tis not to me she speaks :
Two of the fairest stars in all the heaven ,
Having some business , do entreat her eyes 
To twinkle in their spheres till they return .
What if her eyes were there , they in her head ?
The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars 
As daylight doth a lamp ; her eyes in heaven 
Would through the airy region stream so bright 
That birds would sing and think it were not night .
See , how she leans her cheek upon her hand :
O , that I were a glove upon that hand ,
That I might touch that cheek .

Ay me !

She speaks :
O , speak again , bright angel ; for thou art 
As glorious to this night , being o'er my head ,
As is a winged messenger of heaven 
Unto the white-upturned wond'ring eyes 
Of mortals , that fall back to gaze on him 
When he bestrides the lazy-pacing clouds ,
And sails upon the bosom of the air .

O Romeo , Romeo , wherefore art thou Romeo ?
Deny thy father , and refuse thy name ;
Or , if thou wilt not , be but sworn my love ,
And I'll no longer be a Capulet .

Shall I hear more , or shall I speak at this ?

'Tis but thy name that is my enemy ;
Thou art thyself though , not a Montague .
What's Montague ? it is nor hand , nor foot ,
Nor arm , nor face , nor any other part 
Belonging to a man . O , be some other name :
What's in a name ? that which we call a rose 
By any other name would smell as sweet ;
So Romeo would , were he not Romeo call'd ,
Retain that dear perfection which he owes 
Without that title . Romeo , doff thy name ;
And for that name , which is no part of thee ,
Take all myself .

I take thee at thy word .
Call me but love , and I'll be new baptiz'd ;
Henceforth I never will be Romeo .

What man art thou , that , thus bescreen'd in night ,
So stumblest on my counsel ?

By a name 
I know not how to tall thee who I am :
My name , dear saint , is hateful to myself ,
Because it is an enemy to thee :
Had I it written , I would tear the word .

My ears have not yet drunk a hundred words 
Of that tongue's uttering , yet I know the sound :
Art thou not Romeo , and a Montague ?

Neither , fair maid , if either thee dislike .

How cam'st thou hither , tell me , and wherefore ?
The orchard walls are high and hard to climb ,
And the place death , considering who thou art ,
If any of my kinsmen find thee here .

With love's light wings did I o'erperch these walls ;
For stony limits cannot hold love out ,
And what love can do that dares love attempt ;
Therefore thy kinsmen are no stop to me .

If they do see thee they will murder thee .

Alack , there lies more peril in thine eye 
Than twenty of their swords : look thou but sweet ,
And I am proof against their enmity .

I would not for the world they saw thee here .

I have night's cloak to hide me from their eyes ;
And but thou love me , let them find me here ;
My life were better ended by their hate ,
Than death prorogued , wanting of thy love .

By whose direction found'st thou out this place ?

By Love , that first did prompt me to inquire ;
He lent me counsel , and I lent him eyes .
I am no pilot ; yet , wert thou as far 
As that vast shore wash'd with the furthest sea ,
I would adventure for such merchandise .

Thou know'st the mask of night is on my face ,
Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek 
For that which thou hast heard me speak to-night .
Fain would I dwell on form , fain , fain deny 
What I have spoke : but farewell compliment !
Dost thou love me ? I know thou wilt say 'Ay ;' 
And I will take thy word ; yet , if thou swear'st ,
Thou mayst prove false ; at lovers' perjuries ,
They say , Jove laughs . O gentle Romeo !
If thou dost love , pronounce it faithfully :
Or if thou think'st I am too quickly won ,
I'll frown and be perverse and say thee nay ,
So thou wilt woo ; but else , not for the world .
In truth , fair Montague , I am too fond ,
And therefore thou mayst think my haviour light :
But trust me , gentleman , I'll prove more true 
Than those that have more cunning to be strange .
I should have been more strange , I must confess ,
But that thou over-heard'st , ere I was 'ware ,
My true love's passion : therefore pardon me ,
And not impute this yielding to light love ,
Which the dark night hath so discovered .

Lady , by yonder blessed moon I swear 
That tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops ,

O , swear not by the moon , the inconstant moon ,
That monthly changes in her circled orb ,
Lest that thy love prove likewise variable .

What shall I swear by ?

Do not swear at all ;
Or , if thou wilt , swear by thy gracious self ,
Which is the god of my idolatry ,
And I'll believe thee .

If my heart's dear love 

Well , do not swear . Although I joy in thee ,
I have no joy of this contract to-night :
It is too rash , too unadvis'd , too sudden ;
Too like the lightning , which doth cease to be 
Ere one can say it lightens . Sweet , good-night !
This bud of love , by summer's ripening breath ,
May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet .
Good-night , good-night , as sweet repose and rest 
Come to thy heart as that within my breast !

O , wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied ?

What satisfaction canst thou have to-night ?

The exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine .

I gave thee mine before thou didst request it ;
And yet I would it were to give again .

Wouldst thou withdraw it ? for what purpose , love ?

But to be frank , and give it thee again .
And yet I wish but for the thing I have :
My bounty is as boundless as the sea ,
My love as deep ; the more I give to thee ,
The more I have , for both are infinite .

I hear some noise within ; dear love , adieu !
Anon , good nurse , Sweet Montague , be true .
Stay but a little , I will come again .


O blessed , blessed night , I am afeard ,
Being in night , all this is but a dream ,
Too flattering-sweet to be substantial .


Three words , dear Romeo , and good-night indeed .
If that thy bent of love be honourable ,
Thy purpose marriage , send me word to-morrow ,
By one that I'll procure to come to thee ,
Where , and what time , thou wilt perform the rite ;
And all my fortunes at thy foot I'll lay ,
And follow thee my lord throughout the world .

Madam !

I come , anon .But if thou mean'st not well ,
I do beseech thee ,

Madam !

By and by ; I come :
To cease thy suit , and leave me to my grief :
To-morrow will I send .

So thrive my soul ,

A thousand times good-night !


A thousand times the worse , to want thy light .
Love goes toward love , as schoolboys from their books ;
But love from love , toward school with heavy looks .

Hist , Romeo , hist , O , for a falconer's voice ,
To lure this tassel-gentle back again .
Bondage is hoarse , and may not speak aloud ,
Else would I tear the cave where Echo lies ,
And make her airy tongue more hoarse than mine ,
With repetition of my Romeo's name .

It is my soul that calls upon my name :
How silver-sweet sound lovers' tongues by night ,
Like softest music to attending ears !

Romeo !

My dear !

At what o'clock to-morrow 
Shall I send to thee ?

At the hour of nine .

I will not fail ; 'tis twenty years till then .
I have forgot why I did call thee back .

Let me stand here till thou remember it .

I shall forget , to have thee still stand there ,
Remembering how I love thy company .

And I'll still stay , to have thee still forget ,
Forgetting any other home but this .

'Tis almost morning ; I would have thee gone ;
And yet no further than a wanton's bird ,
Who lets it hop a little from her hand ,
Like a poor prisoner in his twisted gyves ,
And with a silk thread plucks it back again ,
So loving-jealous of his liberty .

I would I were thy bird .

Sweet , so would I :
Yet I should kill thee with much cherishing .
Good-night , good-night , parting is such sweet sorrow 
That I shall say good-night till it be morrow .


Sleep dwell upon thine eyes , peace in thy breast !
Would I were sleep and peace , so sweet to rest !
Hence will I to my ghostly father's cell ,
His help to crave , and my dear hap to tell .


The grey-ey'd morn smiles on the frowning night ,
Chequering the eastern clouds with streaks of light ,
And flecked darkness like a drunkard reels 
From forth day's path and Titan's fiery wheels :
Now , ere the sun advance his burning eye 
The day to cheer and night's dank dew to dry ,
I must up-fill this osier cage of ours 
With baleful weeds and precious-juiced flowers .
The earth that's nature's mother is her tomb ;
What is her burying grave that is her womb ,
And from her womb children of divers kind 
We sucking on her natural bosom find ,
Many for many virtues excellent ,
None but for some , and yet all different .
O , mickle is the powerful grace that lies 
In herbs , plants , stones , and their true qualities :
For nought so vile that on the earth doth live 
But to the earth some special good doth give ,
Nor aught so good but strain'd from that fair use 
Revolts from true birth , stumbling on abuse :
Virtue itself turns vice , being misapplied ,
And vice sometime's by action dignified .
Within the infant rind of this weak flower 
Poison hath residence and medicine power :
For this , being smelt , with that part cheers each part ;
Being tasted , slays all senses with the heart .
Two such opposed foes encamp them still 
In man as well as herbs , grace and rude will ;
And where the worser is predominant ,
Full soon the canker death eats up that plant .


Good morrow , father !

Benedicite !
What early tongue so sweet saluteth me ?
Young son , it argues a distemper'd head 
So soon to bid good morrow to thy bed :
Care keeps his watch in every old man's eye ,
And where care lodges , sleep will never lie ;
But where unbruised youth with unstuff'd brain 
Doth couch his limbs , there golden sleep doth reign :
Therefore thy earliness doth me assure 
Thou art up-rous'd by some distemperature ;
Or if not so , then here I hit it right ,
Our Romeo hath not been in bed to-night .

That last is true ; the sweeter rest was mine .

God pardon sin , wast thou with Rosaline ?

With Rosaline , my ghostly father ? no ;
I have forgot that name , and that name's woe .

That's my good son : but where hast thou been , then ?

I'll tell thee , ere thou ask it me again .
I have been feasting with mine enemy ,
Where on a sudden one hath wounded me ,
That's by me wounded : both our remedies 
Within thy help and holy physic lies :
I bear no hatred , blessed man ; for , lo !
My intercession likewise steads my foe .

Be plain , good son , and homely in thy drift ;
Riddling confession finds but riddling shrift .

Then plainly know my heart's dear love is set 
On the fair daughter of rich Capulet :
As mine on hers , so hers is set on mine ;
And all combin'd , save what thou must combine 
By holy marriage : when and where and how 
We met we woo'd and made exchange of vow ,
I'll tell thee as we pass ; but this I pray ,
That thou consent to marry us to-day .

Holy Saint Francis , what a change is here ;
Is Rosaline , whom thou didst love so dear ,
So soon forsaken ? young men's love then lies 
Not truly in their hearts , but in their eyes .
Jesu Maria , what a deal of brine 
Hath wash'd thy sallow cheeks for Rosaline ;
How much salt water thrown away in waste ,
To season love , that of it doth not taste !
The sun not yet thy sighs from heaven clears ,
Thy old groans ring yet in my ancient ears ;
Lo , here upon thy cheek the stain doth sit 
Of an old tear that is not wash'd off yet .
If e'er thou wast thyself and these woes thine ,
Thou and these woes were all for Rosaline :
And art thou chang'd ? pronounce this sentence then :
Women may fall , when there's no strength in men .

Thou chidd'st me oft for loving Rosaline .

For doting , not for loving , pupil mine .

And bad'st me bury love .

Not in a grave ,
To lay one in , another out to have .

I pray thee , chide not ; she , whom I love now 
Doth grace for grace and love for love allow ;
The other did not so .

O , she knew well 
Thy love did read by rote and could not spell .
But come , young waverer , come , go with me ,
In one respect I'll thy assistant be ;
For this alliance may so happy prove ,
To turn your households' rancour to pure love .

O , let us hence ; I stand on sudden haste .

Wisely and slow ; they stumble that run fast .


Where the devil should this Romeo be ?
Came he not home to-night ?

Not to his father's ; I spoke with his man .

Why that same pale hard-hearted wench , that Rosaline ,
Torments him so , that he will sure run mad .

Tybalt , the kinsman of old Capulet ,
Hath sent a letter to his father's house .

A challenge , on my life .

Romeo will answer it .

Any man that can write may answer a letter .

Nay , he will answer the letter's master , how he dares , being dared .

Alas , poor Romeo , he is already dead ; stabbed with a white wench's black eye ; shot through the ear with a love-song ; the very pin of his heart cleft with the blind bow-boy's butt-shaft ; and is he a man to encounter Tybalt ?

Why , what is Tybalt ?

More than prince of cats , I can tell you . O , he is the courageous captain of compliments . He fights as you sing prick-song , keeps time , distance , and proportion ; rests me his minim rest , one , two , and the third in your bosom ; the very butcher of a silk button , a duellist , a duellist ; a gentleman of the very first house , of the first and second cause . Ah , the immortal passado , the punto reverso , the hay !

The what ?

The pox of such antick , lisping , affecting fantasticoes , these new tuners of accents !'By Jesu , a very good blade !a very tall man , a very good whore .' Why , is not this a lamentable thing , grandsire , that we should be thus afflicted with these strange flies , these fashion-mongers , these pardonnez-mois , who stand so much on the new form that they cannot sit at ease on the old bench ? O , their bons , their bons !


Here comes Romeo , here comes Romeo .

Without his roe , like a dried herring . O flesh , flesh , how art thou fishified , Now is he for the numbers that Petrarch flowed in : Laura to his lady was but a kitchen-wench ; marry , she had a better love to be-rime her ; Dido a dowdy ; Cleopatra a gipsy ; Helen and Hero hildings and harlots ; Thisbe , a grey eye or so , but not to the purpose . Signior Romeo , bon jour , there's a French salutation to your French slop . You gave us the counterfeit fairly last night .

Good morrow to you both . What counterfeit did I give you ?

The slip , sir , the slip ; can you not conceive ?

Pardon , good Mercutio , my business was great ; and in such a case as mine a man may strain courtesy .

That's as much as to say , such a case as yours constrains a man to bow in the hams .

Meaning to curtsy .

Thou hast most kindly hit it .

A most courteous exposition .

Nay , I am the very pink of courtesy .

Pink for flower .

Right .

Why , then , is my pump well flowered .

Well said ; follow me this jest now till thou hast worn out the pump , that , when the single sole of it is worn , the jest may remain after the wearing sole singular .

O single-soled jest , solely singular for the singleness .

Come between us , good Benvolio ; my wit faints .

Switch and spurs , switch and spurs ; or I'll cry a match .

Nay , if thy wits run the wild-goose chase , I have done , for thou hast more of the wild-goose in one of thy wits than , I am sure , I have in my whole five . Was I with you there for the goose ?

Thou wast never with me for anything when thou wast not here for the goose .

I will bite thee by the ear for that jest .

Nay , good goose , bite not .

Thy wit is a very bitter sweeting ; it is a most sharp sauce .

And is it not then well served in to a sweet goose ?

O , here's a wit of cheveril , that stretches from an inch narrow to an ell broad .

I stretch it out for that word 'broad ;' which added to the goose , proves thee far and wide a broad goose .

Why , is not this better now than groaning for love ? now art thou sociable , now art thou Romeo ; now art thou what thou art , by art as well as by nature : for this drivelling love is like a great natural , that runs lolling up and down to hide his bauble in a hole .

Stop there , stop there .

Thou desirest me to stop in my tale against the hair .

Thou wouldst else have made thy tale large .

O , thou art deceived ; I would have made it short ; for I was come to the whole depth of my tale , and meant indeed to occupy the argument no longer .

Here's goodly gear !


A sail , a sail !

Two , two ; a shirt and a smock .

Peter !

Anon !

My fan , Peter .

Good Peter , to hide her face ; for her fan's the fairer face .

God ye good morrow , gentlemen .

God ye good den , fair gentlewoman .

Is it good den ?

'Tis no less , I tell you ; for the bawdy hand of the dial is now upon the prick of noon .

Out upon you , what a man are you !

One , gentlewoman , that God hath made for himself to mar .

By my troth , it is well said ; 'for himself to mar ,' quoth a' ?Gentlemen , can any of you tell me where I may find the young Romeo ?

I can tell you ; but young Romeo will be older when you have found him than he was when you sought him : I am the youngest of that name , for fault of a worse .

You say well .

Yea , is the worst well ? very well took , i' faith ; wisely , wisely .

If you be he , sir , I desire some confidence with you .

She will indite him to some supper .

A bawd , a bawd , a bawd , So ho !

What hast thou found ?

No hare , sir ; unless a hare , sir , in a lenten pie , that is something stale and hoar ere it be spent .


An old hare hoar , and an old hare hoar ,
Is very good meat in Lent :
But a hare that is hoar , is too much for a score ,
When it hoars ere it be spent .

Romeo , will you come to your father's ? we'll to dinner thither .

I will follow you .

Farewell , ancient lady ; farewell , Lady , lady , lady .


Marry , farewell , I pray you , sir , what saucy merchant was this , that was so full of his ropery ?

A gentleman , nurse , that loves to hear himself talk , and will speak more in a minute than he will stand to in a month .

An a' speak anything against me , I'll take him down , an a' were lustier than he is , and twenty such Jacks ; and if I cannot , I'll find those that shall . Scurvy knave , I am none of his flirt-gills ; I am none of his skeins-mates .

And thou must stand by too , and suffer every knave to use me at his pleasure !

I saw no man use you at his pleasure ; if I had , my weapon should quickly have been out , I warrant you . I dare draw as soon as another man , if I see occasion in a good quarrel , and the law on my side .

Now , afore God , I am so vexed , that every part about me quivers . Scurvy knave , Pray you , sir , a word ; and as I told you , my young lady bade me inquire you out ; what she bid me say I will keep to myself ; but first let me tell ye , if ye should lead her into a fool's paradise , as they say , it were a very gross kind of behaviour , as they say : for the gentlewoman is young ; and , therefore , if you should deal double with her , truly it were an ill thing to be offered to any gentlewoman , and very weak dealing .

Nurse , commend me to thy lady and mistress . I protest unto thee ,

Good heart , and i' faith , I will tell her as much . Lord , Lord , she will be a joyful woman .

What wilt thou tell her , nurse ? thou dost not mark me .

I will tell her , sir , that you do protest ; which , as I take it , is a gentlemanlike offer .

Bid her devise 
Some means to come to shrift this afternoon ;
And there she shall at Friar Laurence' cell ,
Be shriv'd and married . Here is for thy pains .

No , truly , sir ; not a penny .

Go to ; I say , you shall .

This afternoon , sir ? well , she shall be there .

And stay , good nurse ; behind the abbey wall :
Within this hour my man shall be with thee ,
And bring thee cords made like a tackled stair ;
Which to the high top-gallant of my joy 
Must be my convoy in the secret night .
Farewell , Be trusty , and I'll quit thy pains .
Farewell , Commend me to thy mistress .

Now God in heaven bless thee , Hark you , sir .

What sayst thou , my dear nurse ?

Is your man secret ? Did you ne'er hear say ,
Two may keep counsel , putting one away ?

I warrant thee my man's as true as steel .

Well , sir ; my mistress is the sweetest lady Lord , Lord !when 'twas a little prating thing ,O , there's a nobleman in town , one Paris , that would fain lay knife aboard ; but she , good soul , had as lief see a toad , a very toad , as see him . I anger her sometimes and tell her that Paris is the properer man ; but , I'll warrant you , when I say so , she looks as pale as any clout in the versal world . Doth not rosemary and Romeo begin both with a letter ?

Ay , nurse : what of that ? both with an R .

Ah , mocker ; that's the dog's name . R is for the No ; I know it begins with some other letter : and she had the prettiest sententious of it , of you and rosemary , that it would do you good to hear it .

Commend me to thy lady .

Ay , a thousand times .

Peter !

Anon !

Before , and apace .


The clock struck nine when I did send the nurse ;
In half an hour she promis'd to return .
Perchance she cannot meet him : that's not so .
O , she is lame : love's heralds should be thoughts ,
Which ten times faster glide than the sun's beams ,
Driving back shadows over lowering hills :
Therefore do nimble-pinion'd doves draw Love ,
And therefore hath the wind-swift Cupid wings .
Now is the sun upon the highmost hill 
Of this day's journey , and from nine till twelve 
Is three long hours , yet she is not come .
Had she affections , and warm youthful blood ,
She'd be as swift in motion as a ball ;
My words would bandy her to my sweet love ,
And his to me :
But old folks , many feign as they were dead ;
Unwieldy , slow , heavy and pale as lead .


O God , she comes . O honey nurse , what news ?

Hast thou met with him ? Send thy man away .

Peter , stay at the gate .


Now , good sweet nurse ; O Lord , why look'st thou sad ?
Though news be sad , yet tell them merrily ;
If good , thou sham'st the music of sweet news 
By playing it to me with so sour a face .

I am aweary , give me leave awhile :
Fie , how my bones ache , What a jaunce have I had !

I would thou hadst my bones , and I thy news .
Nay , come , I pray thee , speak ; good , good nurse , speak .

Jesu , what haste ? can you not stay awhile ?
Do you not see that I am out of breath ?

How art thou out of breath when thou hast breath 
To say to me that thou art out of breath ?
The excuse that thou dost make in this delay 
Is longer than the tale thou dost excuse .
Is thy news good , or bad ? answer to that ;
Say either , and I'll stay the circumstance :
Let me be satisfied , is 't good or bad ?

Well , you have made a simple choice ; you know not how to choose a man : Romeo , no , not he ; though his face be better than any man's , yet his leg excels all men's ; and for a hand , and a foot , and a body , though they be not to be talked on , yet they are past compare . He is not the flower of courtesy , but , I'll warrant him , as gentle as a lamb . Go thy ways , wench ; serve God . What , have you dined at home ?

No , no : but all this did I know before .
What says he of our marriage ? what of that ?

Lord , how my head aches ; what a head have I !
It beats as it would fall in twenty pieces .
My back o' t'other side ; O , my back , my back !
Beshrew your heart for sending me about ,
To catch my death with jauncing up and down .

I' faith , I am sorry that thou art not well .
Sweet , sweet , sweet nurse , tell me , what says my love ?

Your love says , like an honest gentleman , and a courteous , and a kind , and a handsome , and , I warrant , a virtuous ,Where is your mother ?

Where is my mother , why , she is within ;
Where should she be ? How oddly thou repliest :
'Your love says , like an honest gentleman ,
Where is your mother ?' 

O , God's lady dear ,
Are you so hot ? Marry , come up , I trow ;
Is this the poultice for my aching bones ?
Henceforward do your messages yourself .

Here's such a coil , come , what says Romeo ?

Have you got leave to go to shrift to-day ?

I have .

Then hie you hence to Friar Laurence' cell ,
There stays a husband to make you a wife :
Now comes the wanton blood up in your cheeks ,
They'll be in scarlet straight at any news .
Hie you to church ; I must another way ,
To fetch a ladder , by the which your love 
Must climb a bird's nest soon when it is dark ;
I am the drudge and toil in your delight ,
But you shall bear the burden soon at night .
Go ; I'll to dinner : hie you to the cell .

Hie to high fortune , Honest nurse , farewell .


So smile the heaven upon this holy act ,
That after hours with sorrow chide us not !

Amen , amen , but come what sorrow can ,
It cannot countervail the exchange of joy 
That one short minute gives me in her sight :
Do thou but close our hands with holy words ,
Then love-devouring death do what he dare ;
It is enough I may but call her mine .

These violent delights have violent ends ,
And in their triumph die , like fire and powder ,
Which , as they kiss consume : the sweetest honey 
Is loathsome in his own deliciousness 
And in the taste confounds the appetite :
Therefore love moderately ; long love doth so ;
Too swift arrives as tardy as too slow .


Here comes the lady : O , so light a foot 
Will ne'er wear out the everlasting flint :
A lover may bestride the gossamer 
That idles in the wanton summer air ,

And yet not fall ; so light is vanity .

Good even to my ghostly confessor .

Romeo shall thank thee , daughter , for us both .

As much to him , else are his thanks too much .

Ah , Juliet , if the measure of thy joy 
Be heap'd like mine , and that thy skill be more 
To blazon it , then sweeten with thy breath 
This neighbour air , and let rich music's tongue 
Unfold the imagin'd happiness that both 
Receive in either by this dear encounter .

Conceit , more rich in matter than in words ,
Brags of his substance , not of ornament :
They are but beggars that can count their worth ;
But my true love is grown to such excess 
I cannot sum up half my sum of wealth .

Come , come with me , and we will make short work ;
For , by your leaves , you shall not stay alone 
Till holy church incorporate two in one .


I pray thee , good Mercutio , let's retire :
The day is hot , the Capulets abroad ,
And , if we meet , we shall not 'scape a brawl ;
For now , these hot days , is the mad blood stirring .

Thou art like one of those fellows that when he enters the confines of a tavern claps me his sword upon the table and says , 'God send me no need of thee !' and by the operation of the second cup draws him on the drawer , when , indeed , there is no need .

Am I like such a fellow ?

Come , come , thou art as hot a Jack in thy mood as any in Italy ; and as soon moved to be moody , and as soon moody to be moved .

And what to ?

Nay , an there were two such , we should have none shortly , for one would kill the other . Thou , why , thou wilt quarrel with a man that hath a hair more or a hair less in his beard than thou hast . Thou wilt quarrel with a man for cracking nuts , having no other reason but because thou hast hazel eyes . What eye , but such an eye , would spy out such a quarrel ? Thy head is as full of quarrels as an egg is full of meat , and yet thy head hath been beaten as addle as an egg for quarrelling . Thou hast quarrelled with a man for coughing in the street , because he hath wakened thy dog that hath lain asleep in the sun . Didst thou not fall out with a tailor for wearing his new doublet before Easter ? with another , for tying his new shoes with old riband ? and yet thou wilt tutor me from quarrelling !

An I were so apt to quarrel as thou art , any man should buy the fee-simple of my life for an hour and a quarter .

The fee-simple , O simple !

By my head , here come the Capulets .

By my heel , I care not .


Follow me close , for I will speak to them . Gentlemen , good den , a word with one of you .

And but one word with one of us ? Couple it with something ; make it a word and a blow .

You shall find me apt enough to that , sir , an you will give me occasion .

Could you not take some occasion without giving ?

Mercutio , thou consort'st with Romeo ,

Consort , What , dost thou make us minstrels ? an thou make minstrels of us , look to hear nothing but discords : here's my fiddlestick ; here's that shall make you dance . 'Zounds , consort !

We talk here in the public haunt of men :
Either withdraw unto some private place ,
Or reason coldly of your grievances ,
Or else depart ; here all eyes gaze on us .

Men's eyes were made to look , and let them gaze ;
I will not budge for no man's pleasure , I .


Well , peace be with you , sir . Here comes my man .

But I'll be hang'd , sir , if he wear your livery :
Marry , go before to field , he'll be your follower ;
Your worship in that sense may call him 'man .' 

Romeo , the hate I bear thee can afford 
No better term than this ,thou art a villain .

Tybalt , the reason that I have to love thee 
Doth much excuse the appertaining rage 
To such a greeting ; villain am I none ,
Therefore farewell ; I see thou know'st me not .

Boy , this shall not excuse the injuries 
That thou hast done me ; therefore turn and draw .

I do protest I never injur'd thee ,
But love thee better than thou canst devise ,
Till thou shalt know the reason of my love :
And so , good Capulet , which name I tender 
As dearly as my own , be satisfied .

O calm , dishonourable , vile submission !
Alla stoccata carries it away .

Tybalt , you rat-catcher , will you walk ?

What wouldst thou have with me ?

Good king of cats , nothing but one of your nine lives , that I mean to make bold withal , and , as you shall use me hereafter , dry-beat the rest of the eight . Will you pluck your sword out of his pilcher by the ears ? make haste , lest mine be about your ears ere it be out .

I am for you .

Gentle Mercutio , put thy rapier up .

Come , sir , your passado .


Draw , Benvolio ; beat down their weapons .
Gentlemen , for shame , forbear this outrage !
Tybalt , Mercutio , the prince expressly hath 
Forbidden bandying in Verona streets .
Hold , Tybalt , good Mercutio !


I am hurt .
A plague o' both your houses , I am sped .
Is he gone , and hath nothing ?

What , art thou hurt ?

Ay , ay , a scratch , a scratch ; marry , 'tis enough .
Where is my page ? Go , villain , fetch a surgeon .


Courage , man ; the hurt cannot be much .

No , 'tis not so deep as a well , nor so wide as a church door ; but 'tis enough , 'twill serve : ask for me to-morrow , and you shall find me a grave man . I am peppered , I warrant , for this world . A plague o' both your houses , 'Zounds , a dog , a rat , a mouse , a cat , to scratch a man to death , a braggart , a rogue , a villain , that fights by the book of arithmetic , Why the devil came you between us ? I was hurt under your arm .

I thought all for the best .

Help me into some house , Benvolio ,
Or I shall faint . A plague o' both your houses !
They have made worms' meat of me : I have it ,
And soundly too :your houses !


This gentleman , the prince's near ally ,
My very friend , hath got his mortal hurt 
In my behalf ; my reputation stain'd 
With Tybalt's slander , Tybalt , that an hour 
Hath been my kinsman . O sweet Juliet !
Thy beauty hath made me effeminate ,
And in my temper soften'd valour's steel !


O Romeo , Romeo , brave Mercutio's dead ;
That gallant spirit hath aspir'd the clouds ,
Which too untimely here did scorn the earth .

This day's black fate on more days doth depend ;
This but begins the woe others must end .


Here comes the furious Tybalt back again .

Alive , in triumph , and Mercutio slain !
Away to heaven , respective lenity ,
And fire-ey'd fury be my conduct now !
Now , Tybalt , take the villain back again 
That late thou gav'st me ; for Mercutio's soul 
Is but a little way above our heads ,
Staying for thine to keep him company :
Either thou , or I , or both , must go with him .

Thou wretched boy , that didst consort him here ,
Shalt with him hence .

This shall determine that .


Romeo , away , be gone !
The citizens are up , and Tybalt slain .
Stand not amaz'd : the prince will doom thee death 
If thou art taken : hence , be gone , away !

O , I am Fortune's fool .

Why dost thou stay ?

Which way ran he that kill'd Mercutio ?
Tybalt , that murderer , which way ran he ?

There lies that Tybalt .

Up , sir , go with me .
I charge thee in the prince's name , obey .


Where are the vile beginners of this fray ?

O noble prince , I can discover all 
The unlucky manage of this fatal brawl :
There lies the man , slain by young Romeo ,
That slew thy kinsman , brave Mercutio .

Tybalt , my cousin , O my brother's child !
O prince , O cousin , husband , O , the blood is spill'd 
Of my dear kinsman . Prince , as thou art true ,
For blood of ours shed blood of Montague .
O cousin , cousin !

Benvolio , who began this bloody fray ?

Tybalt , here slain , whom Romeo's hand did slay :
Romeo , that spoke him fair , bade him bethink 
How nice the quarrel was , and urg'd withal 
Your high displeasure : all this , uttered 
With gentle breath , calm look , knees humbly bow'd ,
Could not take truce with the unruly spleen 
Of Tybalt deaf to peace , but that he tilts 
With piercing steel at bold Mercutio's breast ,
Who , all as hot , turns deadly point to point ,
And , with a martial scorn , with one hand beats 
Cold death aside , and with the other sends 
It back to Tybalt , whose dexterity 
Retorts it : Romeo he cries aloud ,
'Hold , friends , friends , part !' and , swifter than his tongue ,
His agile arm beats down their fatal points ,
And 'twixt them rushes ; underneath whose arm 
An envious thrust from Tybalt hit the life 
Of stout Mercutio , and then Tybalt fled ;
But by and by comes back to Romeo ,
Who had but newly entertain'd revenge ,
And to 't they go like lightning , for , ere I .
Could draw to part them , was stout Tybalt slain ,
And , as he fell , did Romeo turn and fly .
This is the truth , or let Benvolio die .

He is a kinsman to the Montague ;
Affection makes him false , he speaks not true :
Some twenty of them fought in this black strife 
And all those twenty could but kill one life .
I beg for justice , which thou , prince , must give ;
Romeo slew Tybalt , Romeo must not live .

Romeo slew him , he slew Mercutio ;
Who now the price of his dear blood doth owe ?

Not Romeo , prince , he was Mercutio's friend ,
His fault concludes but what the law should end ,
The life of Tybalt .

And for that offence 
Immediately we do exile him hence :
I have an interest in your hate's proceeding ,
My blood for your rude brawls doth lie a-bleeding ;
But I'll amerce you with so strong a fine 
That you shall all repent the loss of mine .
I will be deaf to pleading and excuses ;
Nor tears nor prayers shall purchase out abuses ;
Therefore use none ; let Romeo hence in haste ,
Else , when he's found , that hour is his last .
Bear hence this body and attend our will :
Mercy but murders , pardoning those that kill .


Gallop apace , you fiery-footed steeds ,
Towards Ph bus' lodging ; such a waggoner 
As Ph thon would whip you to the west ,
And bring in cloudy night immediately .
Spread thy close curtain , love-performing night !
That runaway's eyes may wink , and Romeo 
Leap to these arms , untalk'd of and unseen !
Lovers can see to do their amorous rites 
By their own beauties ; or , if love be blind ,
It best agrees with night . Come , civil night ,
Thou sober-suited matron , all in black ,
And learn me how to lose a winning match ,
Play'd for a pair of stainless maidenhoods :
Hood my unmann'd blood , bating in my cheeks ,
With thy black mantle ; till strange love , grown bold ,
Think true love acted simple modesty .
Come , night , come , Romeo , come , thou day in night !
For thou wilt lie upon the wings of night ,
Whiter than new snow on a raven's back .
Come , gentle night ; come , loving , black-brow'd night ,
Give me my Romeo : and , when he shall die ,
Take him and cut him out in little stars ,
And he will make the face of heaven so fine 
That all the world will be in love with night ,
And pay no worship to the garish sun .
O , I have bought the mansion of a love ,
But not possess'd it , and , though I am sold ,
Not yet enjoy'd . So tedious is this day 
As is the night before some festival 
To an impatient child that hath new robes 
And may not wear them . O , here comes my nurse ,


And she brings news ; and every tongue that speaks 
But Romeo's name speaks heavenly eloquence .
Now nurse , what news ? What hast thou there ? the cords 

That Romeo bade thee fetch ?

Ay , ay , the cords .


Ah me , what news ? why dost thou wring thy hands ?

Ah well-a-day , he's dead , he's dead , he's dead !
We are undone , lady , we are undone !
Alack the day , he's gone , he's killed , he's dead !

Can heaven be so envious ?

Romeo can ,
Though heaven cannot . O , Romeo , Romeo ;
Who ever would have thought it ? Romeo !

What devil art thou that dost torment me thus ?
This torture should be roar'd in dismal hell .
Hath Romeo slain himself ? say thou but 'I ,' 
And that bare vowel , 'I ,' shall poison more 
Than the death-darting eye of cockatrice :
I am not I , if there be such an 'I ;' 
Or those eyes shut that make thee answer 'I .' 
If he be slain , say 'I ;' or if not 'no :' 
Brief sounds determine of my weal or woe .

I saw the wound , I saw it with mine eyes ,
God save the mark , here on his manly breast :
A piteous corse , a bloody piteous corse ;
Pale , pale as ashes , all bedaub'd in blood ,
All in gore blood ; I swounded at the sight .

O break , my heart !poor bankrupt , break at once !
To prison , eyes , ne'er look on liberty !
Vile earth , to earth resign ; end motion here ;
And thou and Romeo press one heavy bier !

O Tybalt , Tybalt , the best friend I had :
O courteous Tybalt , honest gentleman !
That ever I should live to see thee dead !

What storm is this that blows so contrary ?
Is Romeo slaughter'd , and is Tybalt dead ?
My dearest cousin , and my dearer lord ?
Then , dreadful trumpet , sound the general doom !
For who is living if those two are gone ?

Tybalt is gone , and Romeo banished ;
Romeo , that kill'd him , he is banished .

O God , did Romeo's hand shed Tybalt's blood ?

It did , it did ; alas the day , it did .

O serpent heart , hid with a flowering face !
Did ever dragon keep so fair a cave ?
Beautiful tyrant , fiend angelical !
Dove-feather'd raven , wolvish-ravening lamb !
Despised substance of divinest show !
Just opposite to what thou justly seem'st ;
A damned saint , an honourable villain !
O , nature , what hadst thou to do in hell 
When thou didst bower the spirit of a fiend 
In mortal paradise of such sweet flesh ?
Was ever book containing such vile matter 
So fairly bound ? O , that deceit should dwell 
In such a gorgeous palace .

There's no trust ,
No faith , no honesty in men ; all naught ,
All perjur'd , all dissemblers , all forsworn .
Ah , where's my man ? give me some aqua vit :
These griefs , these woes , these sorrows make me old .
Shame come to Romeo !

Blister'd be thy tongue 
For such a wish , he was not born to shame :
Upon his brow shame is asham'd to sit ;
For 'tis a throne where honour may be crown'd 
Sole monarch of the universal earth .
O , what a beast was I to chide at him .

Will you speak well of him that kill'd your cousin ?

Shall I speak ill of him that is my husband ?
Ah , poor my lord , what tongue shall smooth thy name ,
When I , thy three-hours wife , have mangled it ?
But , wherefore , villain , didst thou kill my cousin ?
That villain cousin would have kill'd my husband :
Back , foolish tears , back to your native spring ;
Your tributary drops belong to woe ,
Which you , mistaking , offer up to joy .
My husband lives , that Tybalt would have slain ;
And Tybalt's dead , that would have slain my husband :
All this is comfort ; wherefore weep I then ?
Some word there was , worser than Tybalt's death ,
That murder'd me : I would forget it fain ;
But O , it presses to my memory ,
Like damned guilty deeds to sinners' minds .
'Tybalt is dead , and Romeo banished !' 
That 'banished ,' that one word 'banished ,' 
Hath slain ten thousand Tybalts . Tybalt's death 
Was woe enough , if it had ended there :
Or , if sour woe delights in fellowship ,
And needly will be rank'd with other griefs ,
Why follow'd not , when she said 'Tybalt's dead ,' 
Thy father , or thy mother , nay , or both ,
Which modern lamentation might have mov'd ?
But with a rearward following Tybalt's death ,
'Romeo is banished !' to speak that word 
Is father , mother , Tybalt , Romeo , Juliet ,
All slain , all dead : 'Romeo is banished !' 
There is no end , no limit , measure , bound 
In that word's death ; no words can that woe sound .
Where is my father and my mother , nurse ?

Weeping and wailing over Tybalt's corse :
Will you go to them ? I will bring you thither .

Wash they his wounds with tears : mine shall be spent ,
When theirs are dry , for Romeo's banishment .
Take up those cords . Poor ropes , you are beguil'd ,
Both you and I , for Romeo is exil'd :
He made you for a highway to my bed ,
But I , a maid , die maiden-widowed .
Come , cords ; come , nurse ; I'll to my wedding bed ;
And death , not Romeo , take my maidenhead !

Hie to your chamber ; I'll find Romeo 
To comfort you : I wot well where he is .
Hark ye , your Romeo will be here to-night :
I'll to him ; he is hid at Laurence' cell .

O , find him ; give this ring to my true knight ,
And bid him come to take his last farewell .


Romeo , come forth ; come forth , thou fearful man :
Affliction is enamour'd of thy parts ,
And thou art wedded to calamity .


Father , what news ? what is the prince's doom ?
What sorrow craves acquaintance at my hand ,
That I yet know not ?

Too familiar 
Is my dear son with such sour company :
I bring thee tidings of the prince's doom .

What less than doomsday is the prince's doom ?

A gentler judgment vanish'd from his lips ,
Not body's death , but body's banishment .

Ha , banishment , be merciful , say 'death ;' 
For exile hath more terror in his look ,
Much more than death : do not say 'banishment .' 

Hence from Verona art thou banished .
Be patient , for the world is broad and wide .

There is no world without Verona walls ,
But purgatory , torture , hell itself .
Hence banished is banish'd from the world ,
And world's exile is death ; then 'banished ,' 
Is death mis-term'd . Calling death 'banished ,' 
Thou cutt'st my head off with a golden axe ,
And smil'st upon the stroke that murders me .

O deadly sin , O rude unthankfulness !
Thy fault our law calls death ; but the kind prince ,
Taking thy part , hath rush'd aside the law ,
And turn'd that black word death to banishment :
This is dear mercy , and thou seest it not .

'Tis torture , and not mercy : heaven is here ,
Where Juliet lives ; and every cat and dog 
And little mouse , every unworthy thing ,
Live here in heaven and may look on her ;
But Romeo may not : more validity ,
More honourable state , more courtship lives 
In carrion flies than Romeo : they may seize 
On the white wonder of dear Juliet's hand ,
And steal immortal blessing from her lips ,
Who , even in pure and vestal modesty ,
Still blush , as thinking their own kisses sin ;
Flies may do this , but I from this must fly :
They are free men , but I am banished .
And sayst thou yet that exile is not death ?
Hadst thou no poison mix'd , no sharp-ground knife ,
No sudden mean of death , though ne'er so mean ,
But 'banished' to kill me ? 'Banished !' 
O friar , the damned use that word in hell ;
Howlings attend it : how hast thou the heart ,
Being a divine , a ghostly confessor ,
A sin-absolver , and my friend profess'd ,
To mangle me with that word 'banished ?' 

Thou fond mad man , hear me but speak a word .

O , thou wilt speak again of banishment .

I'll give thee armour to keep off that word ;
Adversity's sweet milk , philosophy ,
To comfort thee , though thou art banished .

Yet 'banished !' Hang up philosophy !
Unless philosophy can make a Juliet ,
Displant a town , reverse a prince's doom ,
It helps not , it prevails not : talk no more .

O , then I see that madmen have no ears .

How should they , when that wise men have no eyes ?

Let me dispute with thee of thy estate .

Thou canst not speak of that thou dost not feel :
Wert thou as young as I , Juliet thy love ,
An hour but married , Tybalt murdered ,
Doting like me , and like me banished ,
Then mightst thou speak , then mightst thou tear thy hair ,
And fall upon the ground , as I do now ,
Taking the measure of an unmade grave .


Arise ; one knocks : good Romeo , hide thyself .

Not I ; unless the breath of heart-sick groans ,
Mist-like , infold me from the search of eyes .


Hark , how they knock . Who's there ? Romeo arise ;
Thou wilt be taken . Stay awhile , Stand up ;

Run to my study . By and by , God's will !
What wilfulness is this , I come , I come !

Who knocks so hard ? whence come you ? what's your will ?

Let me come in , and you shall know my errand :
I come from Lady Juliet .

Welcome , then .


O holy friar , O , tell me , holy friar ,
Where is my lady's lord ? where's Romeo ?

There on the ground , with his own tears made drunk .

O , he is even in my mistress' case ,
Just in her case !

O woeful sympathy !
Piteous predicament , Even so lies she ,
Blubbering and weeping , weeping and blubbering .
Stand up , stand up ; stand , an you be a man :
For Juliet's sake , for her sake , rise and stand ;
Why should you fall into so deep an O ?

Nurse !

Ah , sir , ah , sir , Well , death's the end of all .

Spak'st thou of Juliet ? how is it with her ?
Doth she not think me an old murderer ,
Now I have stain'd the childhood of our joy .
With blood remov'd but little from her own ?
Where is she ? and how doth she ? and what says 
My conceal'd lady to our cancell'd love ?

O , she says nothing , sir , but weeps and weeps ;
And now falls on her bed ; and then starts up ,
And Tybalt calls , and then on Romeo cries ,
And then down falls again .

As if that name ,
Shot from the deadly level of a gun ,
Did murder her ; as that name's cursed hand 
Murder'd her kinsman . O , tell me , friar , tell me ,
In what vile part of this anatomy 
Doth my name lodge ? tell me , that I may sack 
The hateful mansion .


Hold thy desperate hand :
Art thou a man ? thy form cries out thou art :
Thy tears are womanish ; thy wild acts denote 
The unreasonable fury of a beast :
Unseemly woman in a seeming man ;
Or ill-beseeming beast in seeming both !
Thou hast amaz'd me : by my holy order ,
I thought thy disposition better temper'd .
Hast thou slain Tybalt ? wilt thou slay thyself ?
And slay thy lady that in thy life lives ,
By doing damned hate upon thyself ?
Why rail'st thou on thy birth , the heaven , and earth ?
Since birth , and heaven , and earth , all three do meet 
In thes at once , which thou at once wouldst lose .
Fie , fie , thou sham'st thy shape , thy love , thy wit ,
Which , like a usurer , abound'st in all ,
And usest none in that true use indeed 
Which should bedeck thy shape , thy love , thy wit .
Thy noble shape is but a form of wax ,
Digressing from the valour of a man ;
Thy dear love , sworn , but hollow perjury ,
Killing that love which thou hast vow'd to cherish ;
Thy wit , that ornament to shape and love ,
Misshapen in the conduct of them both ,
Like powder in a skilless soldier's flask ,
To set a-fire by thine own ignorance ,
And thou dismember'd with thine own defence .
What , rouse thee , man ; thy Juliet is alive ,
For whose dear sake thou wast but lately dead ;
There art thou happy : Tybalt would kill thee ,
But thou slew'st Tybalt ; there art thou happy too :
The law that threaten'd death becomes thy friend ,
And turns it to exile ; there art thou happy :
A pack of blessings light upon thy back ;
Happiness courts thee in her best array ;
But , like a misbehav'd and sullen wench ,
Thou pout'st upon thy fortune and thy love .
Take heed , take heed , for such die miserable .
Go , get thee to thy love , as was decreed ,
Ascend her chamber , hence and comfort her ;
But look thou stay not till the watch be set ,
For then thou canst not pass to Mantua ;
Where thou shalt live , till we can find a time 
To blaze your marriage , reconcile your friends ,
Beg pardon of the prince , and call thee back 
With twenty hundred thousand times more joy 
Than thou went'st forth in lamentation .
Go before , nurse : commend me to thy lady ;
And bid her hasten all the house to bed ,
Which heavy sorrow makes them apt unto :
Romeo is coming .

O Lord , I could have stay'd here all the night 
To hear good counsel : O , what learning is .
My lord , I'll tell my lady you will come .

Do so , and bid my sweet prepare to chide .

Here , sir , a ring she bid me give you , sir .
Hie you , make haste , for it grows very late .


How well my comfort is reviv'd by this !

Go hence ; good-night ; and here stands all your state :
Either be gone before the watch be set ,
Or by the break of day disguis'd from hence :
Sojourn in Mantua ; I'll find out your man ,
And he shall signify from time to time 
Every good hap to you that chances here .
Give me thy hand ; 'tis late : farewell ; goodnight .

But that a joy past joy calls out on me ,
It were a grief so brief to part with thee :
Farewell .


Things have fall'n out , sir , so unluckily ,
That we have had no time to move our daughter :
Look you , she lov'd her kinsman Tybalt dearly ,
And so did I : well , we were born to die .
'Tis very late , she'll not come down to night :
I promise you , but for your company ,
I would have been a-bed an hour ago .

These times of woe afford no time to woo .
Madam , good-night : commend me to your daughter .

I will , and know her mind early to-morrow ;
To-night she's mew'd up to her heaviness .

Sir Paris , I will make a desperate tender 
Of my child's love : I think she will be rul'd 
In all respects by me ; nay , more , I doubt it not .
Wife go you to her ere you go to bed ;
Acquaint her here of my son Paris' love ;
And bid her , mark you me , on Wednesday next 
But , soft , what day is this ?

Monday , my lord .

Monday , ha , ha , Well , Wednesday is too soon ;
O' Thursday let it be : o' Thursday , tell her ,
She shall be married to this noble earl .
Will you be ready ? do you like this haste ?
We'll keep no great ado ; a friend or two ;
For , hark you , Tybalt being slain so late ,
It may be thought we held him carelessly ,
Being our kinsman , if we revel much .
Therefore we'll have some half a dozen friends ,
And there an end . But what say you to Thursday ?

My lord , I would that Thursday were to-morrow .

Well , get you gone : o' Thursday be it then .
Go you to Juliet ere you go to bed ,
Prepare her , wife , against this wedding-day .
Farewell , my lord . Light to my chamber , ho !
Afore me , it is so very very late ,
That we may call it early by and by .
Good-night .


Wilt thou be gone ? it is not yet near day :
It was the nightingale , and not the lark ,
That pierc'd the fearful hollow of thine ear ;
Nightly she sings on you pomegranate tree :
Believe me , love , it was the nightingale .

It was the lark , the herald of the morn ,
No nightingale : look , love , what envious streaks 
Do lace the severing clouds in yonder east :
Night's candles are burnt out , and jocund day 
Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops :
I must be gone and live , or stay and die .

Yon light is not daylight , I know it , I :
It is some meteor that the sun exhales ,
To be to thee this night a torch-bearer ,
And light thee on thy way to Mantua :
Therefore stay yet ; thou need'st not to be gone .

Let me be ta'en , let me be put to death ;
I am content , so thou wilt have it so .
I'll say yon grey is not the morning's eye ,
'Tis but the pale reflex of Cynthia's brow ;
Nor that is not the lark , whose notes do beat 
The vaulty heaven so high above our heads :
I have more care to stay than will to go :
Come , death , and welcome , Juliet wills it so .
How is't , my soul ? let's talk ; it is not day .

It is , it is ; hie hence , be gone , away !
It is the lark that sings so out of tune ,
Straining harsh discords and unpleasing sharps .
Some say the lark makes sweet division ;
This doth not so , for she divideth us :
Some say the lark and loathed toad change eyes ;
O , now I would they had chang'd voices too ,
Since arm from arm that voice doth us affray ,
Hunting thee hence with hunts-up to the day .
O , now be gone ; more light and light it grows .

More light and light ; more dark and dark our woes .


Madam !

Nurse !

Your lady mother is coming to your chamber :
The day is broke ; be wary , look about .


Then , window , let day in , and let life out .

Farewell , farewell , one kiss , and I'll descend .


Art thou gone so ? my lord , my love , my friend !
I must hear from thee every day in the hour ,
For in a minute there are many days :
O , by this count I shall be much in years 
Ere I again behold my Romeo .

Farewell !
I will omit no opportunity 
That may convey my greetings , love , to thee .

O , think'st thou we shall ever meet again ?

I doubt it not ; and all these woes shall serve 
For sweet discourses in our time to come .

O God , I have an ill-divining soul :
Methinks I see thee , now thou art so low ,
As one dead in the bottom of a tomb :
Either my eyesight fails , or thou look'st pale .

And trust me , love , in my eye so do you :
Dry sorrow drinks our blood . Adieu , adieu !


O fortune , fortune , all men call thee fickle :
If thou art fickle , what dost thou with him 
That is renown'd for faith ? Be fickle , fortune ;
For then , I hope , thou wilt not keep him long ,
But send him back .

Ho , daughter , are you up ?

Who is't that calls ? is it my lady mother ?
Is she not down so late , or up so early ?
What unaccustom'd cause procures her hither ?


Why , how now , Juliet !

Madam , I am not well .

Evermore weeping for your cousin's death ?
What , wilt thou wash him from his grave with tears ?
And if thou couldst , thou couldst not make him live ;
Therefore , have done : some grief shows much of love ;
But much of grief shows still some want of wit .

Yet let me weep for such a feeling loss .

So shall you feel the loss , but not the friend 
Which you weep for .

Feeling so the loss ,
I cannot choose but ever weep the friend .

Well , girl , thou weep'st not so much for his death ,
As that the villain lives which slaughter'd him .

What villain , madam ?

That same villain , Romeo .

Villain and he be many miles asunder .
God pardon him , I do , with all my heart ;
And yet no man like he doth grieve my heart .

That is because the traitor murderer lives .

Ay , madam , from the reach of these my hands .
Would none but I might venge my cousin's death !

We will have vengeance for it , fear thou not :
Then weep no more . I'll send to one in Mantua ,
Where that same banish'd runsgate doth live ;
Shall give him such an unaccustom'd dram 
That he shall soon keep Tybalt company :
And then , I hope , thou wilt be satisfied .

Indeed , I never shall be satisfied 
With Romeo , till I behold him dead 
Is my poor heart so for a kinsman vex'd :
Madam , if you could find out but a man 
To bear a poison , I would temper it ,
That Romeo should , upon receipt thereof ,
Soon sleep in quiet . O , how my heart abhors 
To hear him nam'd , and cannot come to him ,
To wreak the love I bore my cousin Tybalt 
Upon his body that hath slaughter'd him .

Find thou the means , and I'll find such a man .
But now I'll tell thee joyful tidings , girl .

And joy comes well in such a needy time :
What are they , I beseech your ladyship ?

Well , well , thou hast a careful father , child ;
One who , to put thee from thy heaviness ,
Hath sorted out a sudden day of joy 
That thou expect'st not , nor I look'd not for .

Madam , in happy time , what day is that ?

Marry , my child , early next Thursday morn 
The gallant , young , and noble gentleman ,
The County Paris , at Saint Peter's church ,
Shall happily make thee there a joyful bride .

Now , by Saint Peter's church , and Peter too ,
He shall not make me there a joyful bride .
I wonder at this haste ; that I must wed 
Ere he that should be husband comes to woo .
I pray you , tell my lord and father , madam ,
I will not marry yet ; and , when I do , I swear ,
It shall be Romeo , whom you know I hate ,
Rather than Paris . These are news indeed !

Here comes your father ; tell him so yourself ,
And see how he will take it at your hands .


When the sun sets , the air doth drizzle dew ;
But for the sunset of my brother's son 
It rains downright .
How now , a conduit , girl ? what , still in tears ?
Evermore showering ? In one little body 
Thou counterfeit'st a bark , a sea , a wind ;
For still thy eyes , which I may call the sea ,
Do ebb and flow with tears ; the bark thy body is ,
Sailing in this salt flood ; the winds , thy sighs ;
Who , raging with thy tears , and they with them ,
Without a sudden calm , will overset 
Thy tempest-tossed body . How now , wife !
Have you deliver'd to her our decree ?

Ay , sir ; but she will none , she gives you thanks .
I would the fool were married to her grave !

Soft , take me with you , take me with you , wife .
How , will she none ? doth she not give us thanks ?
Is she not proud ? doth she not count her bless'd ,
Unworthy as she is , that we have wrought 
So worthy a gentleman to be her bridegroom ?

Not proud , you have ; but thankful , that you have :
Proud can I never be of what I hate ;
But thankful even for hate , that is meant love .

How now , how now , chop-logic , What is this ?
'Proud ,' and 'I thank you ,' and 'I thank you not ;' 
And yet 'not proud ;' mistress minion , you ,
Thank me no thankings , nor proud me no prouds ,
But fettle your fine joints 'gainst Thursday next ,
To go with Paris to Saint Peter's church ,
Or I will drag thee on a hurdle thither .
Out , you green-sickness carrion , out , you baggage !
You tallow face !

Fie , fie , what , are you mad ?

Good father , I beseech you on my knees ,
Hear me with patience but to speak a word .

Hang thee , young baggage , disobedient wretch !
I tell thee what , get thee to church o' Thursday ,
Or never after look me in the face .
Speak not , reply not , do not answer me ;
My fingers itch .Wife , we scarce thought us bless'd 
That God had lent us but this only child ;
But now I see this one is one too much ,
And that we have a curse in having her .
Out on her , hilding !

God in heaven bless her !
You are to blame , my lord , to rate her so .

And why , my lady wisdom ? hold your tongue ,
Good prudence ; smatter with your gossips , go .

I speak no treason .

O , God ye good den .

May not one speak ?

Peace , you mumbling fool ;
Utter your gravity o'er a gossip's bowl ;
For here we need it not .

You are too hot .

God's bread , it makes me mad .
Day , night , hour , tide , time , work , play ,
Alone , in company , still my care hath been 
To have her match'd ; and having now provided 
A gentleman of noble parentage ,
Of fair demesnes , youthful , and nobly train'd ,
Stuff'd , as they say , with honourable parts ,
Proportion'd as one's thought would wish a man ;
And then to have a wretched puling fool ,
A whining mammet , in her fortune's tender ,
To answer 'I'll not wed ,' 'I cannot love ,' 
'I am too young ,' 'I pray you , pardon me ;' 
But , an you will not wed , I'll pardon you :
Graze where you will , you shall not house with me :
Look to't , think on't , I do not use to jest .
Thursday is near ; lay hand on heart , advise .
An you be mine , I'll give you to my friend ;
An you be not , hang , beg , starve , die in the streets ,
For , by my soul , I'll ne'er acknowledge thee ,
Nor what is mine shall never do thee good .
Trust to't , bethink you ; I'll not be forsworn .


Is there no pity sitting in the clouds ,
That sees into the bottom of my grief ?
O , sweet my mother , cast me not away :
Delay this marriage for a month , a week ;
Or , if you do not , make the bridal bed 
In that dim monument where Tybalt lies .

Talk not to me , for I'll not speak a word .
Do as thou wilt , for I have done with thee .


O God , O nurse , how shall this be prevented ?
My husband is on earth , my faith in heaven ;
How shall that faith return again to earth ,
Unless that husband send it me from heaven 
By leaving earth ? comfort me , counsel me .
Alack , alack , that heaven should practise stratagems 
Upon so soft a subject as myself !
What sayst thou ? hast thou not a word of joy ?
Some comfort , nurse ?

Faith , here it is . Romeo 
Is banished ; and all the world to nothing 
That he dares ne'er come back to challenge you ;
Or , if he do , it needs must be by stealth .
Then , since the case so stands as now it doth ,
I think it best you married with the county .
O , he's a lovely gentleman ;
Romeo's a dishclout to him : an eagle , madam ,
Hath not so green , so quick , so fair an eye 
As Paris hath . Beshrew my very heart ,
I think you are happy in this second match ,
For it excels your first : or if it did not ,
Your first is dead ; or 'twere as good he were ,
As living here and you no use of him .

Speakest thou from thy heart ?

And from my soul too ;
Or else beshrew them both .

Amen !

What !

Well , thou hast comforted me marvellous much .
Go in ; and tell my lady I am gone ,
Having displeas'd my father , to Laurence' cell ,
To make confession and to be absolv'd .

Marry , I will ; and this is wisely done .


Ancient damnation , O most wicked fiend !
Is it more sin to wish me thus forsworn ,
Or to dispraise my lord with that same tongue 
Which she hath prais'd him with above compare 
So many thousand times ? Go , counsellor ;
Thou and my bosom henceforth shall be twain .
I'll to the friar , to know his remedy :
If all else fail , myself have power to die .


On Thursday , sir ? the time is very short .

My father Capulet will have it so ;
And I am nothing slow to slack his haste .

You say you do not know the lady's mind :
Uneven is the course , I like it not .

Immoderately she weeps for Tybalt's death ,
And therefore have I little talk'd of love ;
For Venus smiles not in a house of tears .
Now , sir , her father counts it dangerous 
That she doth give her sorrow so much sway ,
And in his wisdom hastes our marriage 
To stop the inundation of her tears ;
Which , too much minded by herself alone ,
May be put from her by society .
Now do you know the reason of this haste .

I would I knew not why it should be slow'd .
Look , sir , here comes the lady towards my cell .


Happily met , my lady and my wife !

That may be , sir , when I may be a wife .

That may be must be , love , on Thursday next .

What must be shall be .

That's a certain text .

Come you to make confession to this father ?

To answer that , I should confess to you .

Do not deny to him that you love me .

I will confess to you that I love him .

So will ye , I am sure , that you love me .

If I do so , it will be of more price ,
Being spoke behind your back , than to your face .

Poor soul , thy face is much abus'd with tears .

The tears have got small victory by that ;
For it was bad enough before their spite .

Thou wrong'st it , more than tears , with that report .

That is no slander , sir , which is a truth ;
And what I spake , I spake it to my face .

Thy face is mine , and thou hast slander'd it .

It may be so , for it is not mine own .
Are you at leisure , holy father , now ;
Or shall I come to you at evening mass ?

My leisure serves me , pensive daughter , now :
My lord , we must entreat the time alone .

God shield , I should disturb devotion !
Juliet , on Thursday early will I rouse you :
Till then , adieu ; and keep this holy kiss .


O , shut the door , and when thou hast done so ,
Come weep with me ; past hope , past cure , past help !

Ah , Juliet , I already know thy grief ;
It strains me past the compass of my wits :
I hear thou must , and nothing may prorogue it ,
On Thursday next be married to this county .

Tell me not , friar , that thou hear'st of this ,
Unless thou tell me how I may prevent it :
If , in thy wisdom , thou canst give no help ,
Do thou but call my resolution wise ,
And with this knife I'll help it presently ,
God join'd my heart and Romeo's , thou our hands ;
And ere this hand , by thee to Romeo seal'd ,
Shall be the label to another deed ,
Or my true heart with treacherous revolt 
Turn to another , this shall slay them both .
Therefore , out of thy long-experienc'd time ,
Give me some present counsel ; or behold ,
'Twixt my extremes and me this bloody knife 
Shall play the umpire , arbitrating that 
Which the commission of thy years and art 
Could to no issue of true honour bring .
Be not so long to speak ; I long to die ,
If what thou speak'st speak not of remedy .

Hold , daughter ; I do spy a kind of hope ,
Which craves as desperate an execution 
As that is desperate which we would prevent .
If , rather than to marry County Paris ,
Thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself ,
Then is it likely thou wilt undertake 
A thing like death to chide away this shame ,
That cop'st with death himself to 'scape from it ;
And , if thou dar'st , I'll give thee remedy .

O , bid me leap , rather than marry Paris ,
From off the battlements of yonder tower ;
Or walk in thievish ways ; or bid me lurk 
Where serpents are ; chain me with roaring bears ;
Or shut me nightly in a charnel-house ,
O'er-cover'd quite with dead men's rattling bones ,
With reeky shanks , and yellow chapless skulls ;
Or bid me go into a new-made grave 
And hide me with a dead man in his shroud ;
Things that , to hear them told , have made me tremble ;
And I will do it without fear or doubt ,
To live an unstain'd wife to my sweet love .

Hold , then ; go home , be merry , give consent 
To marry Paris : Wednesday is to-morrow !
To-morrow night look that thou lie alone ,
Let not thy nurse lie with thee in thy chamber :
Take thou this vial , being then in bed ,
And this distilled liquor drink thou off ;
When presently through all thy veins shall run 
A cold and drowsy humour , for no pulse 
Shall keep his native progress , but surcease ;
No warmth , no breath , shall testify thou liv'st ;
The roses in thy lips and cheeks shall fade 
To paly ashes ; thy eyes' windows fall ,
Like death , when he shuts up the day of life ;
Each part , depriv'd of supple government ,
Shall , stiff and stark and cold , appear like death ;
And in this borrow'd likeness of shrunk death 
Thou shalt continue two-and-forty hours ,
And then awake as from a pleasant sleep .
Now , when the bridegroom in the morning comes 
To rouse thee from thy bed , there art thou dead :
Then as the manner of our country is 
In thy best robes uncover'd on the bier ,
Thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault 
Where all the kindred of the Capulets lie .
In the mean time , against thou shalt awake ,
Shall Romeo by my letters know our drift ,
And hither shall he come ; and he and I 
Will watch thy waking , and that very night 
Shall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua .
And this shall free thee from this present shame ;
If no unconstant toy , nor womanish fear ,
Abate thy valour in the acting it .

Give me , give me , O , tell me not of fear !

Hold ; get you gone , be strong and prosperous 
In this resolve . I'll send a friar with speed 
To Mantua , with my letters to thy lord .

Love , give me strength , and strength shall help afford .
Farewell , dear father !


So many guests invite as here are writ .

Sirrah , go hire me twenty cunning cooks .

You shall have none ill , sir ; for 
I'll try if they can lick their fingers .

How canst thou try them so ?

Marry , sir , 'tis an ill cook that cannot lick his own fingers : therefore he that cannot lick his fingers goes not with me .

Go , be gone .

We shall be much unfurnish'd for this time .
What , is my daughter gone to Friar Laurence ?

Ay , forsooth .

Well , he may chance to do some good on her :
A peevish self-will'd harlotry it is .

See where she comes from shrift with merry look .


How now , my headstrong , where have you been gadding ?

Where I have learn'd me to repent the sin 
Of disobedient opposition 
To you and your behests ; and am enjoin'd 
By holy Laurence to fall prostrate here ,
And beg your pardon . Pardon , I beseech you !
Henceforward I am ever rul'd by you .

Send for the county ; go tell him of this :
I'll have this knot knit up to-morrow morning .

I met the youthful lord at Laurence' cell ;
And gave him what becomed love I might ,
Not stepping o'er the bounds of modesty .

Why , I'm glad on't ; this is well : stand up :
This is as't should be . Let me see the county ;
Ay , marry , go , I say , and fetch him hither .
Now , afore God , this reverend holy friar ,
All our whole city is much bound to him .

Nurse , will you go with me into my closet ,
To help me sort such needful ornaments 
As you think fit to furnish me to-morrow ?

No , not till Thursday ; there is time enough .

Go , nurse , go with her . We'll to church to-morrow .


We shall be short in our provision :
'Tis now near night .

Tush , I will stir about ,
And all things shall be well , I warrant thee , wife :
Go thou to Juliet , help to deck up her ;
I'll not to bed to-night ; let me alone ;
I'll play the housewife for this once . What , ho !
They are all forth : well , I will walk myself 
To County Paris ; to prepare him up 
Against to-morrow . My heart is wondrous light ,
Since this same wayward girl is so reclaim'd .


Ay , those attires are best ; but , gentle nurse ,
I pray thee , leave me to myself to-night ;
For I have need of many orisons 
To move the heavens to smile upon my state ,
Which , well thou know'st , is cross and full of sin .


What , are you busy , ho ? need you my help ?

No , madam ; we have cull'd such necessaries 
As are behoveful for our state to-morrow :
So please you , let me now be left alone ,
And let the nurse this night sit up with you ;
For , I am sure , you have your hands full all 
In this so sudden business .

Good-night :
Get thee to bed , and rest ; for thou hast need .


Farewell , God knows when we shall meet again .
I have a faint cold fear thrills through my veins ,
That almost freezes up the heat of life :
I'll call them back again to comfort me :
Nurse , What should she do here ?
My dismal scene I needs must act alone .
Come , vial .
What if this mixture do not work at all ?
Shall I be married then to-morrow morning ?
No , no ; this shall forbid it : lie thou there .

What if it be a poison , which the friar 
Subtly hath minister'd to have me dead ,
Lest in this marriage he should be dishonour'd 
Because he married me before to Romeo ?
I fear it is : and yet , methinks , it should not ,
For he hath still been tried a holy man .
I will not entertain so bad a thought .
How if , when I am laid into the tomb ,
I wake before the time that Romeo 
Come to redeem me ? there's a fearful point !
Shall I not then be stifled in the vault ,
To whose foul mouth no healthsome air breathes in ,
And there die strangled ere my Romeo comes ?
Or , if I live , is it not very like ,
The horrible conceit of death and night ,
Together with the terror of the place ,
As in a vault , an ancient receptacle ,
Where , for these many hundred years , the bones 
Of all my buried ancestors are pack'd ;
Where bloody Tybalt , yet but green in earth ,
Lies festering in his shroud ; where , as they say ,
At some hours in the night spirits resort :
Alack , alack , is it not like that I ,
So early waking , what with loathsome smells ,
And shrieks like mandrakes' torn out of the earth ,
That living mortals , hearing them , run mad :
O , if I wake , shall I not be distraught ,
Environed with all these hideous fears ,
And madly play with my forefathers' joints ,
And pluck the mangled Tybalt from his shroud ?
And , in this rage , with some great kinsman's bone ,
As with a club , dash out my desperate brains ?
O , look , methinks I see my cousin's ghost 
Seeking out Romeo , that did spit his body 
Upon a rapier's point . Stay , Tybalt , stay !
Romeo , I come , this do I drink to thee .


Hold , take these keys , and fetch more spices , nurse .

They call for dates and quinces in the pastry .


Come , stir , stir , stir , the second cock hath crow'd ,
The curfew bell hath rung , 'tis three o'clock :
Look to the bak'd meats , good Angelica :
Spare not for cost .

Go , go , you cot-quean , go ;
Get you to bed ; faith , you'll be sick to-morrow 
For this night's watching .

No , not a whit ; what , I have watch'd ere now 
All night for lesser cause , and ne'er been sick .

Ay , you have been a mouse-hunt in your time ;
But I will watch you from such watching now .


A jealous-hood , a jealous-hood !


Now , fellow ,

What's there ?

Things for the cook , sir ; but I know not what .

Make haste , make haste .

Sirrah , fetch drier logs :
Call Peter , he will show thee where they are .

I have a head , sir , that will find out logs ,
And never trouble Peter for the matter .


Mass , and well said ; a merry whoreson , ha !
Thou shalt be logger-head . Good faith , 'tis day :
The county will be here with music straight ,
For so he said he would .

I hear him near .
Nurse , Wife , what , ho , What , nurse , I say !


Go waken Juliet , go and trim her up ;
I'll go and chat with Paris . Hie , make haste ,
Make haste ; the bridegroom he is come already :
Make haste , I say .

Mistress , what , mistress , Juliet , fast , I warrant her , she :
Why , lamb , why , lady , fie , you slug-a-bed !
Why , love , I say , madam , sweet-heart , why , bride !
What , not a word ? you take your pennyworths now :
Sleep for a week ; for the next night , I warrant ,
The County Paris hath set up his rest ,
That you shall rest but little . God forgive me ,
Marry , and amen , how sound is she asleep !
I needs must wake her . Madam , madam , madam !
Ay , let the county take you in your bed ;
He'll fright you up , i' faith . Will it not be ?
What , dress'd , and in your clothes , and down again !
I must needs wake you . Lady , lady , lady !
Alas , alas , Help , help , my lady's dead !
O , well-a-day , that ever I was born .
Some aqua-vit , ho , My lord , my lady !


What noise is here ?

O lamentable day !

What is the matter ?

Look , look , O heavy day !

O me , O me , my child , my only life ,
Revive , look up , or I will die with thee !
Help , help , Call help .


For shame , bring Juliet forth ; her lord is come .

She's dead , deceas'd , she's dead ; alack the day !

Alack the day , she's dead , she's dead , she's dead !

Ha , let me see her . Out , alas , she's cold ;
Her blood is settled , and her joints are stiff ;
Life and these lips have long been separated :
Death lies on her like an untimely frost 
Upon the sweetest flower of all the field .

O lamentable day !

O woeful time !

Death , that hath ta'en her hence to make me wail ,
Ties up my tongue , and will not let me speak .


Come , is the bride ready to go to church ?

Ready to go , but never to return .
O son , the night before thy wedding-day 
Hath Death lain with thy wife . There she lies ,
Flower as she was , deflowered by him .
Death is my son-in-law , Death is my heir ;
My daughter he hath wedded : I will die ,
And leave him all ; life , living , all is Death's !

Have I thought long to see this morning's face ,
And doth it give me such a sight as this ?

Accurs'd , unhappy , wretched , hateful-day !
Most miserable hour , that e'er time saw 
In lasting labour of his pilgrimage !
But one , poor one , one poor and loving child ,
But one thing to rejoice and solace in ,
And cruel death hath catch'd it from my sight !

O woe , O woeful , woeful , woeful day !
Most lamentable day , most woeful day ,
That ever , ever , I did yet behold !
O day , O day , O day , O hateful day !
Never was seen so black a day as this :
O woeful day , O woeful day !

Beguil'd , divorced , wronged , spited , slain !
Most detestable death , by thee beguil'd ,
By cruel cruel thee quite overthrown !
O love , O life , not life , but love in death !

Despis'd , distressed , hated , martyr'd , kill'd !
Uncomfortable time , why cam'st thou now 
To murder , murder our solemnity ?
O child , O child , my soul , and not my child !
Dead art thou , dead , alack , my child is dead ;
And with my child my joys are buried !

Peace , ho , for shame , confusion's cure lives not 
In these confusions . Heaven and yourself 
Had part in this fair maid ; now heaven hath all ,
And all the better is it for the maid :
Your part in her you could not keep from death ,
But heaven keeps his part in eternal life .
The most you sought was her promotion ,
For 'twas your heaven she should be advanc'd ;
And weep ye now , seeing she is advanc'd 
Above the clouds , as high as heaven itself ?
O , in this love , you love your child so ill ,
That you run mad , seeing that she is well :
She's not well married that lives married long ;
But she's best married that dies married young .
Dry up your tears , and stick your rosemary 
On this fair corse ; and , as the custom is ,
In all her best array bear her to church ;
For though fond nature bids us all lament ,
Yet nature's tears are reason's merriment .

All things that we ordained festival ,
Turn from their office to black funeral ;
Our instruments to melancholy bells ,
Our wedding cheer to a sad burial feast ,
Our solemn hymns to sullen dirges change ,
Our bridal flowers serve for a buried corse ,
And all things change them to the contrary .

Sir , go you in ; and , madam , go with him ;
And go , Sir Paris ; every one prepare 
To follow this fair corse unto her grave .
The heavens do lower upon you for some ill ;
Move them no more by crossing their high will .


Faith , we may put up our pipes , and be gone .

Honest good fellows , ah , put up , put up , for , well you know , this is a pitiful case .


Ay , by my troth , the case may be amended .


Musicians , O , musicians , 'Heart's ease , Heart's ease :' O , an ye will have me live , play 'Heart's ease .' 

Why 'Heart's ease ?' 

O , musicians , because my heart itself plays 'My heart is full of woe ;' O , play me some merry dump , to comfort me .

Not a dump we ; 'tis no time to play now .

You will not then ?

No .

I will then give it you soundly .

What will you give us ?

No money , on my faith , but the gleek ;
I will give you the minstrel .

Then will I give you the serving-creature .

Then will I lay the serving-creature's dagger on your pate , I will carry no crotchets :
I'll re you , I'll fa you . Do you note me ?

An you re us , and fa us , you note us .

Pray you , put up your dagger , and put out your wit .

Then have at you with my wit , I will dry-beat you with an iron wit , and put up my iron dagger . Answer me like men :

When griping grief the heart doth wound ,
And doleful dumps the mind oppress ,
Then music with her silver sound 

Why 'silver sound ?' why 'music with her silver sound ?' What say you , Simon Catling ?

Marry , sir , because silver hath a sweet sound .

Pretty , What say you , Hugh Rebeck ?

I say 'silver sound ,' because musicians sound for silver .

Pretty too , What say you , James Soundpost ?

Faith , I know not what to say .

O , I cry you mercy ; you are the singer ;
I will say for you . It is , 'music with her silver sound ,' because musicians have no gold for sounding :

Then music with her silver sound 
With speedy help doth lend redress .

What a pestilent knave is this same !

Hang him , Jack , Come , we'll in here ; tarry for the mourners , and stay dinner .


If I may trust the flattering truth of sleep ,
My dreams presage some joyful news at hand :
My bosom's lord sits lightly in his throne ;
And all this day an unaccustom'd spirit 
Lifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts .
I dreamt my lady came and found me dead ;
Strange dream , that gives a dead man leave to think ,
And breath'd such life with kisses in my lips ,
That I reviv'd , and was an emperor .
Ah me , how sweet is love itself possess'd ,
When but love's shadows are so rich in joy !


News from Verona , How now , Balthasar ?
Dost thou not bring me letters from the friar ?
How doth my lady ? Is my father well ?
How fares my Juliet ? That I ask again ;

For nothing can be ill if she be well .

Then she is well , and nothing can be ill ;
Her body sleeps in Capel's monument ,
And her immortal part with angels lives .
I saw her laid low in her kindred's vault ,
And presently took post to tell it you .
O , pardon me for bringing these ill news ,
Since you did leave it for my office , sir .

Is it even so ? then I defy you , stars !
Thou know'st my lodging : get me ink and paper ,
And hire post-horses ; I will hence to-night .

I do beseech you , sir , have patience :
Your looks are pale and wild , and do import 
Some misadventure .

Tush , thou art deceiv'd ;
Leave me , and do the thing I bid thee do .
Hast thou no letters to me from the friar ?

No , my good lord .

No matter ; get thee gone ,
And hire those horses : I'll be with thee straight .

Well , Juliet , I will he with thee to-night .
Let's see for means : O mischief , thou art swift 
To enter in the thoughts of desperate men .
I do remember an apothecary ,
And hereabouts he dwells , which late I noted 
In tatter'd weeds , with overwhelming brows ,
Culling of simples ; meagre were his looks ,
Sharp misery had worn him to the bones :
And in his needy shop a tortoise hung ,
An alligator stuff'd , and other skins 
Of ill-shap'd fishes ; and about his shelves 
A beggarly account of empty boxes ,
Green earthen pots , bladders , and musty seeds ,
Remnants of packthread , and old cakes of roses ,
Were thinly scatter'd , to make up a show .
Noting this penury , to myself I said 
An if a man did need a poison now ,
Whose sale is present death in Mantua ,
Here lives a caitiff wretch would sell it him .
O , this same thought did but fore-run my need ,
And this same needy man must sell it me .
As I remember , this should be the house :
Being holiday , the beggar's shop is shut .
What , ho , apothecary !


Who calls so loud ?

Come hither , man . I see that thou art poor ;
Hold , there is forty ducats ; let me have 
A dram of poison , such soon-speeding gear 
As will disperse itself through all the veins 
That the life-weary taker may fall dead ,
And that the trunk may be discharg'd of breath 
As violently as hasty powder fir'd 
Doth hurry from the fatal cannon's womb .

Such mortal drugs I have ; but Mantua's law 
Is death to any he that utters them .

Art thou so bare , and full of wretchedness ,
And fear'st to die ? famine is in thy cheeks ,
Need and oppression starveth in thine eyes ,
Contempt and beggary hang upon thy back ;
The world is not thy friend nor the world's law :
The world affords no law to make thee rich ;
Then be not poor , but break it , and take this .

My poverty , but not my will , consents .

I pay thy poverty , and not thy will .

Put this in any liquid thing you will ,
And drink it off ; and , if you had the strength 
Of twenty men , it would dispatch you straight .

There is thy gold , worse poison to men's souls ,
Doing more murders in this loathsome world 
Than these poor compounds that thou mayst not sell :
I sell thee poison , thou hast sold me none .
Farewell ; buy food , and get thyself in flesh .
Come , cordial and not poison , go with me 
To Juliet's grave , for there must I use thee .


Holy Franciscan friar , brother , ho !


This same should be the voice of Friar John .
Welcome from Mantua : what says Romeo ?
Or , if his mind be writ , give me his letter .

Going to find a bare-foot brother out ,
One of our order , to associate me ,
Here in this city visiting the sick ,
And finding him , the searchers of the town ,
Suspecting that we both were in a house 
Where the infectious pestilence did reign ,
Seal'd up the doors , and would not let us forth ;
So that my speed to Mantua there was stay'd .

Who bare my letter then to Romeo ?

I could not send it , here it is again ,
Nor get a messenger to bring it thee ,
So fearful were they of infection .

Unhappy fortune , by my brotherhood ,
The letter was not nice , but full of charge 
Of dear import ; and the neglecting it 
May do much danger . Friar John , go hence ;
Get me an iron crow , and bring it straight 
Unto my cell .

Brother , I'll go and bring it thee .


Now must I to the monument alone ;
Within these three hours will fair Juliet wake :
She will beshrew me much that Romeo 
Hath had no notice of these accidents ;
But I will write again to Mantus ,
And keep her at my cell till Romeo come :
Poor living corse , clos'd in a dead man's tomb !


Give me thy torch , boy : hence , and stand aloof ;
Yet put it out , for I would not be seen .
Under yond yew-trees lay thee all along ,
Holding thine ear close to the hollow ground :
So shall no foot upon the churchyard tread ,
Being loose , unfirm with digging up of graves ,
But thou shalt hear it : whistle then to me ,
As signal that thou hear'st something approach .
Give me those flowers . Do as I bid thee ; go .

I am almost afraid to stand alone 
Here in the churchyard ; yet I will adventure .


Sweet flower , with flowers thy bridal bed I strew ,
O woe , thy canopy is dust and stones ;
Which with sweet water nightly I will dew ,
Or , wanting that , with tears distill'd by moans :
The obsequies that I for thee will keep 
Nightly shall be to strew thy grave and weep .

The boy gives warning something doth approach .
What cursed foot wanders this way to-night ,
To cross my obsequies and true love's rite ?
What , with a torch ?muffle me , night , awhile .

Give me that mattock , and the wrenching iron .
Hold , take this letter ; early in the morning 
See thou deliver it to my lord and father .
Give me the light : upon thy life I charge thee ,
Whate'er thou hear'st or seest , stand all aloof ,
And do not interrupt me in my course .
Why I descend into this bed of death ,
Is partly , to behold my lady's face ;
But chiefly to take thence from her dead finger 
A precious ring , a ring that I must use 
In dear employment : therefore hence , be gone :
But , if thou , jealous , dost return to pry 
In what I further shall intend to do ,
By heaven , I will tear thee joint by joint ,
And strew this hungry churchyard with thy limbs .
The time and my intents are savage-wild ,
More fierce and more inexorable far 
Than empty tigers or the roaring sea .

I will be gone , sir , and not trouble you .

So shalt thou show me friendship . Take thou that :
Live , and be prosperous ; and farewell , good fellow .

For all this same , I'll hide me here about :
His looks I fear , and his intents I doubt .


Thou detestable maw , thou womb of death ,
Gorg'd with the dearest morsel of the earth ,
Thus I enforce thy rotten jaws to open ,

And , in despite , I'll cram thee with more food !

This is that banish'd haughty Montague ,
That murder'd my love's cousin , with which grief 
It is supposed the fair creature died ;
And here is come to do some villanous shame 
To the dead bodies : I will apprehend him .

Stop thy unhallow'd toil , vile Montague ,
Can vengeance be pursu'd further than death ?
Condemned villain , I do apprehend thee :
Obey , and go with me ; for thou must die .

I must , indeed ; and therefore came I hither .
Good gentle youth , tempt not a desperate man ;
Fly hence and leave me : think upon these gone ;
Let them affright thee . I beseech thee , youth ,
Put not another sin upon my head 
By urging me to fury : O , be gone :
By heaven , I love thee better than myself .
For I come hither arm'd against myself :
Stay not , be gone ; live , and hereafter say 
A madman's mercy bade thee run away .

I do defy thy conjurations ,
And apprehend thee for a felon here .

Wilt thou provoke me ? then have at thee , boy !


O Lord , they fight : I will go call the watch .


O , I am slain !If thou be merciful ,
Open the tomb , lay me with Juliet .


In faith , I will . Let me peruse this face :
Mercutio's kinsman , noble County Paris !
What said my man when my betossed soul 
Did not attend him as we rode ? I think 
He told me Paris should have married Juliet :
Said he not so ? or did I dream it so ?
Or am I mad , hearing him talk of Juliet ,
To think it was so ? O , give me thy hand ,
One writ with me in sour misfortune's book :
I'll bury thee in a triumphant grave ;
A grave ? O , no , a lanthorn , slaughter'd youth ,
For here lies Juliet , and her beauty makes 
This vault a feasting presence full of light .
Death , lie thou there , by a dead man interr'd ,

How oft when men are at the point of death 
Have they been merry , which their keepers call 
A lightning before death : O , how may I 
Call this a lightning ? O my love , my wife !
Death , that hath suck'd the honey of thy breath ,
Hath had no power yet upon thy beauty :
Thou art not conquer'd ; beauty's ensign yet 
Is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks ,
And death's pale flag is not advanced there .
Tybalt , liest thou there in thy bloody sheet ?
O , what more favour can I do to thee ,
Than with that hand that cut thy youth in twain 
To sunder his that was thine enemy ?
Forgive me , cousin , Ah , dear Juliet ,
Why art thou yet so fair ? Shall I believe 
That unsubstantial Death is amorous ,
And that the lean abhorred monster keeps 
Thee here in dark to be his paramour ?
For fear of that I still will stay with thee ,
And never from this palace of dim night 
Depart again : here , here will I remain 
With worms that are thy chambermaids ; O , here 
Will I set up my everlasting rest ,
And shake the yoke of inauspicious stars 
From this world-wearied flesh . Eyes , look your last !
Arms , take your last embrace , and , lips , O you 
The doors of breath , seal with a righteous kiss 
A dateless bargain to engrossing death !
Come , bitter conduct , come , unsavoury guide !
Thou desperate pilot , now at once run on 
The dashing rocks thy sea-sick weary bark !
Here's to my love !

O true apothecary !
Thy drugs are quick . Thus with a kiss I die .

Saint Francis be my speed , how oft to-night 
Have my old feet stumbled at graves , Who's there ?

Here's one , a friend , and one that knows you well .

Bliss be upon you , Tell me , good my friend ,
What torch is yond , that vainly lends his light 
To grubs and eyeless skulls ? as I discern ,
It burneth in the Capel's monument .

It doth so , holy sir ; and there's my master ,
One that you love .

Who is it ?

Romeo .

How long hath he been there ?

Full half an hour .

Go with me to the vault .

I dare not , sir .
My master knows not but I am gone hence ;
And fearfully did menace me with death 
If I did stay to look on his intents .

Stay then , I'll go alone . Fear comes upon me ;
O , much I fear some ill unlucky thing .

As I did sleep under this yew-tree here ,
I dreamt my master and another fought ,
And that my master slew him .

Romeo !
Alack , alack , what blood is this which stains 
The stony entrance of this sepulchre ?
What mean these masterless and gory swords 
To lie discolour'd by this place of peace ?

Romeo , O , pale , Who else ? what , Paris too ?
And steep'd in blood ? Ah , what an unkind hour 
Is guilty of this lamentable chance .
The lady stirs .


O , comfortable friar , where is my lord ?
I do remember well where I should be ,
And there I am . Where is my Romeo ?


I hear some noise . Lady , come from that nest 
Of death , contagion , and unnatural sleep :
A greater power than we can contradict 
Hath thwarted our intents : come , come away .
Thy husband in thy bosom there lies dead ;
And Paris too : come , I'll dispose of thee 
Among a sisterhood of holy nuns .
Stay not to question , for the watch is coming ;
Come , go , good Juliet .

I dare no longer stay .

Go , get thee hence , for I will not away .

What's here ? a cup , clos'd in my true love's hand ?
Poison , I see , hath been his timeless end .
O churl , drunk all , and left no friendly drop 
To help me after , I will kiss thy lips ;
Haply , some poison yet doth hang on them ,
To make me die with a restorative .

Thy lips are warm !

Lead , boy : which way ?

Yea , noise ? then I'll be brief . O happy dagger !

This is thy sheath ;

there rest , and let me die .

This is the place ; there where the torch doth burn .

The ground is bloody ; search about the churchyard .
Go , some of you ; whoe'er you find , attach .

Pitiful sight , here lies the county slain ,
And Juliet bleeding , warm , and newly dead ,
Who here hath lain these two days buried .
Go , tell the prince , run to the Capulets ,
Raise up the Montagues , some others search :

We see the ground whereon these woes do lie ;
But the true ground of all these piteous woes 
We cannot without circumstance descry .


Here's Romeo's man ; we found him in the churchyard .

Hold him in safety , till the prince come hither .


Here is a friar , that trembles , sighs , and weeps ;
We took this mattock and this spade from him ,
As he was coming from this churchyard side .

A great suspicion : stay the friar too .


What misadventure is so early up ,
That calls our person from our morning's rest ?


What should it be , that they so shriek abroad ?

The people in the street cry Romeo ,
Some Juliet , and some Paris ; and all run 
With open outcry toward our monument .

What fear is this which startles in our ears ?

Sovereign , here lies the County Paris slain ;
And Romeo dead ; and Juliet , dead before ,
Warm and new kill'd .

Search , seek , and know how this foul murder comes .

Here is a friar , and slaughter'd Romeo's man ;
With instruments upon them , fit to open 
These dead men's tombs .

O , heaven !O wife , look how our daughter bleeds !
This dagger hath mista'en !for , lo , his house 
Is empty on the back of Montague 
And is mis-sheathed in my daughter's bosom .

O me , this sight of death is as a bell ,
That warns my old age to a sepulchre .


Come , Montague : for thou art early up ,
To see thy son and heir more early down .

Alas , my liege , my wife is dead to-night ;
Grief of my son's exile hath stopp'd her breath .
What further woe conspires against mine age ?

Look , and thou shalt see .

O thou untaught , what manners is in this ,
To press before thy father to a grave ?

Seal up the mouth of outrage for a while ,
Till we can clear these ambiguities ,
And know their spring , their head , their true descent ;
And then will I be general of your woes ,
And lead you even to death : meantime forbear ,
And let mischance be slave to patience .
Bring forth the parties of suspicion .

I am the greatest , able to do least ,
Yet most suspected , as the time and place 
Doth make against me , of this direful murder ;
And here I stand , both to impeach and purge 
Myself condemned and myself excus'd .

Then say at once what thou dost know in this .

I will be brief , for my short date of breath 
Is not so long as is a tedious tale .
Romeo , there dead , was husband to that Juliet ;
And she , there dead , that Romeo's faithful wife :
I married them ; and their stolen marriage-day 
Was Tybalt's doomsday , whose untimely death 
Banish'd the new-made bridegroom from this city ;
For whom , and not for Tybalt , Juliet pin'd .
You , to remove that siege of grief from her ,
Betroth'd , and would have married her perforce ,
To County Paris : then comes she to me ,
And , with wild looks bid me devise some mean 
To rid her from this second marriage ,
Or in my cell there would she kill herself .
Then gave I her ,so tutor'd by my art ,
A sleeping potion ; which so took effect 
As I intended , for it wrought on her 
The form of death : meantime I writ to Romeo 
That he should hither come as this dire night ,
To help to take her from her borrow'd grave ,
Being the time the potion's force should cease .
But he which bore my letter , Friar John ,
Was stay'd by accident , and yesternight 
Return'd my letter back . Then , all alone ,
At the prefixed hour of her waking ,
Came I to take her from her kindred's vault ,
Meaning to keep her closely at my cell ,
Till I conveniently could send to Romeo :
But , when I came ,some minute ere the time 
Of her awakening ,here untimely lay 
The noble Paris and true Romeo dead .
She wakes ; and I entreated her come forth ,
And bear this work of heaven with patience ;
But then a noise did scare me from the tomb ,
And she , too desperate , would not go with me ,
But , as it seems , did violence on herself .
All this I know ; and to the marriage 
Her nurse is privy : and , if aught in this 
Miscarried by my fault , let my old life 
Be sacrific'd , some hour before his time ,
Unto the rigour of severest law .

We still have known thee for a holy man .
Where's Romeo's man ? what can he say in this ?

I brought my master news of Juliet's death ;
And then in post he came from Mantua 
To this same place , to this same monument .
This letter he early bid me give his father ,
And threaten'd me with death , going in the vault ,
If I departed not and left him there .

Give me the letter ; I will look on it .
Where is the county's page that rais'd the watch ?
Sirrah , what made your master in this place ?

He came with flowers to strew his lady's grave ,
And bid me stand aloof , and so I did ;
Anon , comes one with light to ope the tomb ;
And by and by my master drew on him ;
And then I ran away to call the watch .

This letter doth make good the friar's words ,
Their course of love , the tidings of her death :
And here he writes that he did buy a poison 
Of a poor 'pothecary , and therewithal 
Came to this vault to die , and lie with Juliet .
Where be these enemies ?Capulet , Montague !
See what a scourge is laid upon your hate ,
That heaven finds means to kill your joys with love ;
And I , for winking at your discords too ,
Have lost a brace of kinsmen : all are punish'd .

O brother Montague , give me thy hand :
This is my daughter's jointure , for no more 
Can I demand .

But I can give thee more ;
For I will raise her statue in pure gold ;
That while Verona by that name is known .
There shall no figure at such rate be set 
As that of true and faithful Juliet .

As rich shall Romeo by his lady lie ;
Poor sacrifices of our enmity !

A glooming peace this morning with it brings ;
The sun , for sorrow , will not show his head :
Go hence , to have more talk of these sad things :
Some shall be pardon'd , and some punished :
For never was a story of more woe 
Than this of Juliet and her Romeo .

TIMON OF ATHENS

Good day , sir .

I am glad you're well .

I have not seen you long . How goes the world ?

It wears , sir , as it grows .

Ay , that's well known ;
But what particular rarity ? what strange ,
Which manifold record not matches ? See ,
Magic of bounty , all these spirits thy power 
Hath conjur'd to attend . I know the merchant .

I know them both ; th' other's a jeweller .

O , 'tis a worthy lord .

Nay , that's most fix'd .

A most incomparable man , breath'd , as it were ,
To an untirable and continuate goodness :
He passes .

I have a jewel here 

O , pray , let's see 't : for the Lord Timon , sir ?

If he will touch the estimate : but , for that 

When we for recompense have prais'd the vile ,
It stains the glory in that happy verse 
Which aptly sings the good .

'Tis a good form .

And rich : here is a water , look ye .

You are rapt , sir , in some work , some dedication 
To the great lord .

A thing slipp'd idly from me .
Our poesy is as a gum , which oozes 
From whence 'tis nourish'd : the fire i' the flint 
Shows not till it be struck ; our gentle flame 
Provokes itself , and , like the current flies 
Each bound it chafes . What have you there ?

A picture , sir . When comes your book forth ?

Upon the heels of my presentment , sir .
Let's see your piece .

'Tis a good piece .

So 'tis : this comes off well and excellent .

Indifferent .

Admirable , How this grace 
Speaks his own standing , what a mental power 
This eye shoots forth , how big imagination 
Moves in this lip , to the dumbness of the gesture 
One might interpret .

It is a pretty mocking of the life .
Here is a touch ; is 't good ?

I'll say of it ,
It tutors nature : artificial strife 
Lives in these touches , livelier than life .


How this lord is follow'd !

The senators of Athens : happy man !

Look , more !

You see this confluence , this great flood of visitors .
I have , in this rough work , shap'd out a man ,
Whom this beneath world doth embrace and hug 
With amplest entertainment : my free drift 
Halts not particularly , but moves itself 
In a wide sea of wax : no levell'd malice 
Infects one comma in the course I hold ;
But flies an eagle flight , bold and forth on ,
Leaving no tract behind .

How shall I understand you ?

I will unbolt to you .
You see how all conditions , how all minds 
As well of glib and slippery creatures as 
Of grave and austere quality tender down 
Their services to Lord Timon : his large fortune ,
Upon his good and gracious nature hanging ,
Subdues and properties to his love and tendance 
All sorts of hearts ; yea , from the glass-fac'd flatterer 
To Apemantus , that few things loves better 
Than to abhor himself : even he drops down 
The knee before him and returns in peace 
Most rich in Timon's nod .

I saw them speak together .

Sir , I have upon a high and pleasant hill 
Feign'd Fortune to be thron'd : the base o' the mount 
Is rank'd with all deserts , all kind of natures ,
That labour on the bosom of this sphere 
To propagate their states : amongst them all ,
Whose eyes are on this sovereign lady fix'd ,
One do I personate of Lord Timon's frame ,
Whom Fortune with her ivory hand wafts to her ;
Whose present grace to present slaves and servants 
Translates his rivals .

'Tis conceiv'd to scope .
This throne , this Fortune , and this hill , methinks ,
With one man beckon'd from the rest below ,
Bowing his head against the steepy mount 
To climb his happiness , would be well express'd 
In our condition .

Nay , sir , but hear me on .
All those which were his fellows but of late ,
Some better than his value , on the moment 
Follow his strides , his lobbies fill with tendance ,
Rain sacrificial whisperings in his ear ,
Make sacred even his stirrup , and through him 
Drink the free air .

Ay , marry , what of these ?

When Fortune in her shift and change of mood 
Spurns down her late belov'd , all his dependants 
Which labour'd after him to the mountain's top 
Even on their knees and hands , let him slip down ,
Not one accompanying his declining foot .

'Tis common :
A thousand moral paintings I can show 
That shall demonstrate these quick blows of Fortune's 
More pregnantly than words . Yet you do well 
To show Lord Timon that mean eyes have seen 
The foot above the head .


Imprison'd is he , say you ?

Ay , my good lord : five talents is his debt ,
His means most short , his creditors most strait :
Your honourable letter he desires 
To those have shut him up ; which , failing ,
Periods his comfort .

Noble Ventidius , Well ;
I am not of that feather to shake off 
My friend when he must need me . I do know him 
A gentleman that well deserves a help ,
Which he shall have : I'll pay the debt and free him .

Your lordship ever binds him .

Commend me to him . I will send his ransom ;
And being enfranchis'd , bid him come to me .
'Tis not enough to help the feeble up ,
But to support him after . Fare you well .

All happiness to your honour .

Lord Timon , hear me speak .

Freely , good father .

Thou hast a servant nam'd Lucilius .

I have so : what of him ?

Most noble Timon , call the man before thee .

Attends be here or no ? Lucilius !

Here , at your lordship's service .

This fellow here , Lord Timon , this thy creature ,
By night frequents my house . I am a man 
That from my first have been inclin'd to thrift ,
And my estate deserves an heir more rais'd 
Than one which holds a trencher .

Well ; what further ?

One only daughter have I , no kin else ,
On whom I may confer what I have got :
The maid is fair , o' the youngest for a bride ,
And I have bred her at my dearest cost 
In qualities of the best . This man of thine 
Attempts her love : I prithee , noble lord ,
Join with me to forbid him her resort ;
Myself have spoke in vain .

The man is honest .

Therefore he will be , Timon :
His honesty rewards him in itself ;
It must not bear my daughter .

Does she love him ?

She is young and apt :
Our own precedent passions do instruct us 
What levity's in youth .

Love you the maid ?

Ay , my good lord , and she accepts of it .

If in her marriage my consent be missing ,
I call the gods to witness , I will choose 
Mine heir from forth the beggars of the world ,
And dispossess her all .

How shall she be endow'd ,
If she be mated with an equal husband ?

Three talents on the present ; in future , all .

This gentleman of mine hath serv'd me long :
To build his fortune I will strain a little ,
For 'tis a bond in men . Give him thy daughter ;
What you bestow , in him I'll counterpoise ,
And make him weigh with her .

Most noble lord ,
Pawn me to this your honour , she is his .

My hand to thee ; mine honour on my promise .

Humbly I thank your lordship : never may 
That state or fortune fall into my keeping 
Which is not ow'd to you !


Vouchsafe my labour , and long live your lordship !

I thank you ; you shall hear from me anon :
Go not away . What have you there , my friend ?

A piece of painting , which I do beseech 
Your lordship to accept .

Painting is welcome .
The painting is almost the natural man ;
For since dishonour traffics with man's nature ,
He is but outside : these pencil'd figures are 
Even such as they give out . I like your work ;
And you shall find I like it : wait attendance 
Till you hear further from me .

The gods preserve you !

Well fare you , gentleman : give me your hand ;
We must needs dine together . Sir , your jewel 
Hath suffer'd under praise .

What , my lord , dispraise ?

A mere satiety of commendations .
If I should pay you for 't as 'tis extoll'd ,
It would unclew me quite .

My lord , 'tis rated 
As those which sell would give : but you well know ,
Things of like value , differing in the owners ,
Are prized by their masters . Believe 't , dear lord ,
You mend the jewel by the wearing it .

Well mock'd .

No , my good lord ; he speaks the common tongue ,
Which all men speak with him .

Look , who comes here . Will you be chid ?


We'll bear , with your lordship .

He'll spare none .

Good morrow to thee , gentle Apemantus !

Till I be gentle , stay thou for thy good morrow ;
When thou art Timon's dog , and these knaves honest .

Why dost thou call them knaves ? thou know'st them not .

Are they not Athenians ?

Yes .

Then I repent not .

You know me , Apemantus ?

Thou know'st I do ; I call'd thee by thy name .

Thou art proud , Apemantus .

Of nothing so much as that I am not like Timon .

Whither art going ?

To knock out an honest Athenian's brains .

That's a deed thou'lt die for .

Right , if doing nothing be death by the law .

How likest thou this picture , Apemantus ?

The best , for the innocence .

Wrought he not well that painted it ?

He wrought better that made the painter ; and yet he's but a filthy piece of work .

You're a dog .

Thy mother's of my generation : what's she , if I be a dog ?

Wilt dine with me , Apemantus ?

No ; I eat not lords .

An thou shouldst , thou'dst anger ladies .

O , they eat lords ; so they come by great bellies .

That's a lascivious apprehension .

So thou apprehendest it , take it for thy labour .

How dost thou like this jewel , Apemantus ?

Not so well as plain-dealing , which will not cost a man a doit .

What dost thou think 'tis worth ?

Not worth my thinking . How now , poet !

How now , philosopher !

Thou liest .

Art not one ?

Yes .

Then I lie not .

Art not a poet ?

Yes .

Then thou liest : look in thy last work , where thou hast feigned him a worthy fellow .

That's not feigned ; he is so .

Yes , he is worthy of thee , and to pay thee for thy labour : he that loves to be flattered is worthy o' the flatterer . Heavens , that I were a lord !

What wouldst do then , Apemantus ?

Even as Apemantus does now ; hate a lord with my heart .

What , thyself ?

Ay .

Wherefore ?

That I had no angry wit to be a lord .
Art not thou a merchant ?

Ay , Apemantus .

Traffic confound thee , if the gods will not !

If traffic do it , the gods do it .

Traffic's thy god , and thy god confound thee !


What trumpet's that ?

'Tis Alcihiades , and some twenty horse ,
All of companionship .

Pray , entertain them ; give them guide to us .

You must needs dine with me . Go not you hence 
Till I have thanked you ; when dinner's done ,
Show me this piece . I am joyful of your sights .

Most welcome , sir !

So , so , there !
Aches contract and starve your supple joints !
That there should be small love 'mongst these sweet knaves ,
And all this courtesy , The strain of man's bred out 
Into baboon and monkey .

Sir , you have sav'd my longing , and I feed 
Most hungerly on your sight .

Right welcome , sir !
Ere we depart , we'll share a bounteous time 
In different pleasures . Pray you , let us in .

What time o'day is't , Apemantus ?

Time to be honest .

That time serves still .

The more accursed thou , that still omitt'st it .

Thou art going to Lord Timon's feast ?

Ay ; to see meat fill khaves and wine heat fools .

Fare thee well , fare thee well .

Thou art a fool to bid me farewell twice .

Why , Apemantus ?

Shouldst have kept one to thyself , for I mean to give thee none .

Hang thyself !

No , I will do nothing at thy bidding : make thy requests to thy friend .

Away , unpeaceable dog , or I'll spurn thee hence .

I will fly , like a dog , the heels of an ass .


He's opposite to humanity . Come , shall we in ,
And taste Lord Timon's bounty ? he outgoes 
The very heart of kindness .

He pours it out ; Plutus , the god of gold ,
Is but his steward : no meed but he repays 
Sevenfold above itself ; no gift to him 
But breeds the giver a return exceeding 
All use of quittance .

The noblest mind he carries 
That ever govern'd man .

Long may he live in fortunes !
Shall we in ?

I'll keep you company .

Most honour'd Timon ,
It hath pleas'd the gods to remember my father's age ,
And call him to long peace .
He is gone happy , and has left me rich :
Then , as in grateful virtue I am bound 
To your free heart , I do return those talents ,
Doubled with thanks and service , from whose help 
I deriv'd liberty .

O , by no means ,
Honest Ventidius ; you mistake my love ;
I gave it freely ever ; and there's none 
Can truly say he gives , if he receives :
If our betters play at that game , we must not dare 
To imitate them ; faults that are rich are fair .

A noble spirit .


Nay , my lords , ceremony was but devis'd at first 
To set a gloss on faint deeds , hollow welcomes ,
Recanting goodness , sorry ere 'tis shown ;
But where there is true friendship , there needs none .
Pray , sit ; more welcome are ye to my fortunes 
Than my fortunes to me .


My lord , we always have confess'd it .

Ho , ho , confess'd it ; hang'd it , have you not ?

O , Apemantus , you are welcome .

No ,
You shall not make me welcome :
I come to have thee thrust me out of doors .

Fie , thou'rt a churl ; ye've got a humour there 
Does not become a man ; 'tis much to blame .
They say , my lords , Ira furor brevis est ;
But yond man is ever angry .
Go , let him have a table by himself ,
For he does neither affect company ,
Nor is he fit for it , indeed .

Let me stay at thine apperil , Timon :
I come to observe ; I give thee warning on't .

I take no heed of thee ; thou'rt an Athenian , therefore , welcome . I myself would have no power ; prithee , let my meat make thee silent .

I scorn thy meat ; 'twould choke me , for I should 
Ne'er flatter thee . O you gods , what a number 
Of men eat Timon , and he sees them not .
It grieves me to see so many dip their meat 
In one man's blood ; and all the madness is ,
He cheers them up too .
I wonder men dare trust themselves with men :
Methinks they should invite them without knives ;
Good for their meat , and safer for their lives .
There's much example for't ; the fellow that 
Sits next him now , parts bread with him , and pledges 
The breath of him in a divided draught ,
Is the readiest man to kill him : 't has been prov'd .
If I were a huge man , I should fear to drink at meals ;
Lest they should spy my wind-pipe's dangerous notes :
Great men should drink with harness on their throats .

My lord , in heart ; and let the health go round .

Let it flow this way , my good lord .

Flow this way , A brave fellow , he keeps his tides well . Those healths will make thee and thy state look ill , Timon .
Here's that which is too weak to be a sinner ,
Honest water , which ne'er left man i' the mire :
This and my food are equals , there's no odds :
Feasts are too proud to give thanks to the gods .

Immortal gods , I crave no pelf ;
I pray for no man but myself :
Grant I may never prove so fond ,
To trust man on his oath or bond ;
Or a harlot for her weeping ;
Or a dog that seems a-sleeping ;
Or a keeper with my freedom ;
Or my friends , if I should need 'em .
Amen . So fall to't :
Rich men sin , and I eat root .


Much good dich thy good heart , Apemantus !

Captain Alcibiades , your heart's in the field now .

My heart is ever at your service , my lord .

You had rather be at a breakfast of enemies than a dinner of friends .

So they were bleeding-new , my lord , there's no meat like 'em : I could wish my best friend at such a feast .

'Would all those flatterers were thine enemies then , that then thou mightst kill 'em and bid me to 'em .

Might we but have that happiness , my lord , that you would once use our hearts , whereby we might express some part of our zeals , we should think ourselves for ever perfect .

O , no doubt , my good friends , but the gods themselves have provided that I shall have much help from you : how had you been my friends else ? why have you that charitable title from thousands , did not you chiefly belong to my heart ? I have told more of you to myself than you can with modesty speak in your own behalf ; and thus far I confirm you . O you gods , think I , what need we have any friends , if we should ne'er have need of 'em ? they were the most needless creatures living should we ne'er have use for 'em , and would most resemble sweet instruments hung up in cases , that keep their sounds to themselves . Why , I have often wished myself poorer that I might come nearer to you . We are born to do benefits ; and what better or properer can we call our own than the riches of our friends ? O , what a precious comfort 'tis , to have so many , like brothers , commanding one another's fortunes . O joy , e'en made away ere it can be born . Mine eyes cannot hold out water , methinks : to forget their faults , I drink to you .

Thou weepest to make them drink , Timon .

Joy had the like conception in our eyes ,
And , at that instant , like a babe , sprung up .

Ho , ho , I laugh to think that babe a bastard .

I promise you , my lord , you mov'd me much .

Much !


What means that trump ?

How now !

Please you , my lord , there are certain ladies most desirous of admittance .

Ladies ? What are their wills ?

There comes with them a forerunner , my lord , which bears that office , to signify their pleasures .

I pray , let them be admitted .


Hail to thee , worthy Timon ; and to all 
That of his bounties taste , The five best senses 
Acknowledge thee their patron ; and come freely 
To gratulate thy plenteous bosom . Th' ear ,
Taste , touch , smell , pleas'd from thy table rise ;
They only now come but to feast thine eyes .

They are welcome all ; let 'em have kind admittance :
Music , make their welcome !


You see , my lord , how ample you're belov'd .

Hoy-day , what a sweep of vanity comes this way :
They dance , they are mad women .
Like madness is the glory of this life ,
As this pomp shows to a little oil and root .
We make ourselves fools to disport ourselves ;
And spend our flatteries to drink those men 
Upon whose age we void it up again ,
With poisonous spite and envy .
Who lives that's not depraved or depraves ?
Who dies that bears not one spurn to their graves 
Of their friend's gift ?
I should fear those that dance before me now 
Would one day stamp upon me : it has been done ;
Men shut their doors against a setting sun .


You have done our pleasures much grace , fair ladies ,
Set a fair fashion on our entertainment ,
Which was not half so beautiful and kind ;
You have added worth unto 't and lustre ,
And entertain'd me with mine own device ;
I am to thank you for 't .

My lord , you take us even at the best .

Faith , for the worst is filthy ; and would not hold taking , I doubt me .

Ladies , there is an idle banquet 
Attends you : please you to dispose yourselves .

Most thankfully , my lord .


Flavius !

My lord !

The little casket bring me hither .

Yes , my lord .

More jewels yet !
There is no crossing him in 's humour ;
Else I should tell him well , i' faith , I should ,
When all's spent , he'd be cross'd then , an he could .
'Tis pity bounty had not eyes behind ,
That man might ne'er be wretched for his mind .


Where be our men ?

Here , my lord , in readiness .

Our horses !


O , my friends , I have one word to say to you ;
Look you , my good lord ,
I must entreat you , honour me so much 
As to advance this jewel ; accept it and wear it ,
Kind my lord .

I am so far already in your gifts 

So are we all .


My lord , there are certain nobles of the senate 
Newly alighted , and come to visit you .

They are fairly welcome .

I beseech your honour ,
Vouchsafe me a word ; it does concern you near .

Near , why then another time I'll hear thee .
I prithee , let's be provided to show them entertainment .

I scarce know how .


May it please your honour , Lord Lucius ,
Out of his free love , hath presented to you 
Four milk-white horses , trapp'd in silver .

I shall accept them fairly ; let the presents 
Be worthily entertain'd .

How now , what news ?

Please you , my lord , that honourable gentleman , Lord Lucullus , entreats your company to-morrow to hunt with him , and has sent your honour two brace of greyhounds .

I'll hunt with him ; and let them be receiv'd ,
Not without fair reward .

What will this come to ?
He commands us to provide , and give great gifts ,
And all out of an empty coffer :
Nor will he know his purse , or yield me this ,
To show him what a beggar his heart is ,
Being of no power to make his wishes good .
His promises fly so beyond his state 
That what he speaks is all in debt ; he owes 
For every word : he is so kind that he now 
Pays interest for't ; his land's put to their books .
Well , would I were gently put out of office 
Before I were forc'd out !
Happier he that has no friend to feed 
Than such as do e'en enemies exceed .
I bleed inwardly for my lord .


You do yourselves 
Much wrong , you bate too much of your own merits :
Here , my lord , a trifle of our love .

With more than common thanks I will receive it .

O , he's the very soul of bounty .

And now I remember , my lord , you gave 
Good words the other day of a bay courser 
I rode on : it is yours , because you lik'd it .

O , I beseech you , pardon me , my lord , in that .

You may take my word , my lord ; I know no man 
Can justly praise but what he does affect :
I weigh my friend's affection with mine own ;
I'll tell you true . I'll call to you .

O , none so welcome .

I take all and your several visitations 
So kind to heart , 'tis not enough to give ;
Methinks , I could deal kingdoms to my friends ,
And ne'er be weary . Alcibiades ,
Thou art a soldier , therefore seldom rich ;
It comes in charity to thee ; for all thy living 
Is 'mongst the dead , and all the lands thou hast 
Lie in a pitch'd field .

Ay , defil'd land , my lord .

We are so virtuously bound ,

And so 
Am I to you .

So infinitely endear'd ,

All to you . Lights , more lights !

The best of happiness ,
Honour , and fortunes , keep with you , Lord Timon !

Ready for his friends .


What a coil's here !
Serving of becks and jutting out of bums !
I doubt whether their legs be worth the sums 
That are given for 'em . Friendship's full of dregs :
Methinks , false hearts should never have sound legs .
Thus honest fools lay out their wealth on curtsies .

Now , Apemantus , if thou wert not sullen ,
I would be good to thee .

No , I'll nothing ; for if I should be bribed too , there would be none left to rail upon thee , and then thou wouldst sin the faster . Thou givest so long , Timon , I fear me thou wilt give away thyself in paper shortly : what need these feasts , pomps , and vain-glories ?

Nay , an you begin to rail on society once , I am sworn not to give regard to you . Farewell ; and come with better music .


So :
Thou wilt not hear me now ; thou shalt not then ;
I'll lock thy heaven from thee .
O , that men's ears should be 
To counsel deaf , but not to flattery .

And late , five thousand : to Varro and to Isidore 
He owes nine thousand ; besides my former sum ,
Which makes it five-and-twenty . Still in motion 
Of raging waste , It cannot hold ; it will not .
If I want gold , steal but a beggar's dog 
And give it Timon , why , the dog coins gold ;
If I would sell my horse , and buy twenty more 
Better than he , why , give my horse to Timon ,
Ask nothing , give it him , it foals me , straight ,
And able horses . No porter at his gate ,
But rather one that smiles and still invites 
All that pass by . It cannot hold ; no reason 
Can found his state in safety . Caphis , ho !
Caphis , I say !


Here , sir ; what is your pleasure ?

Get on your cloak , and haste you to Lord Timon ;
Importune him for my moneys ; be not ceas'd 
With slight denial , nor then silenc'd when 
'Commend me to your master' and the cap 
Plays in the right hand , thus ;but tell him ,
My uses cry to me ; I must serve my turn 
Out of mine own ; his days and times are past ,
And my reliances on his fracted dates 
Have smit my credit : I love and honour him ,
But must not break my back to heal his finger ;
Immediate are my needs , and my relief 
Must not be toss'd and turn'd to me in words ,
But find supply immediate . Get you gone :
Put on a most importunate aspect ,
A visage of demand ; for , I do fear ,
When every feather sticks in his own wing ,
Lord Timon will be left a naked gull ,
Which flashes now a ph nix . Get you gone .

I go , sir .

'I go , sir !' Take the bonds along with you ,
And have the dates in compt .

I will , sir .

Go .


No care , no stop , so senseless of expense ,
That he will neither know how to maintain it ,
Nor cease his flow of riot : takes no account 
How things go from him , nor resumes no care 
Of what is to continue : never mind 
Was to be so unwise , to be so kind .
What shall be done ? He will not hear , till feel :
I must be round with him , now he comes from hunting .
Fie , fie , fie , fie !


Good even , Varro . What !
You come for money ?

Is't not your business too ?

It is : and yours too , Isidore ?

It is so .

Would we were all discharg'd !

I fear it .

Here comes the lord !


So soon as dinner's done , we'll forth again ,
My Alcibiades . With me ? what is your will ?

My lord , here is a note of certain dues .

Dues , Whence are you ?

Of Athens here , my lord .

Go to my steward .

Please it your lordship , he hath put me off 
To the succession of new days this month :
My master is awak'd by great occasion 
To call upon his own ; and humbly prays you 
That with your other noble parts you'll suit 
In giving him his right .

Mine honest friend ,
I prithee , but repair to me next morning .

Nay , good my lord ,

Contain thyself , good friend .

One Varro's servant , my good lord ,

From Isidore ;
He humbly prays your speedy payment .

If you did know , my lord , my master's wants ,

'Twas due on forfeiture , my lord , six weeks 
And past .

Your steward puts me off , my lord ;
And I am sent expressly to your lordship .

Give me breath .
I do beseech you , good my lords , keep on ;
I'll wait upon you instantly .

Come hither : pray you ,
How goes the world , that I am thus encounter'd 
With clamorous demands of date-broke bonds ,
And the detention of long-since-due debts ,
Against my honour ?

Please you , gentlemen ,
The time is unagreeable to this business :
Your importunacy cease till after dinner ,
That I may make his lordship understand 
Wherefore you are not paid .

Do so , my friends .
See them well entertained .


Pray , draw near .

Stay , stay ; here comes the fool with 
Apemantus : let's ha' some sport with 'em .

Hang him , he'll abuse us .

A plague upon him , dog !

How dost , fool ?

Dost dialogue with thy shadow ?

I speak not to thee .

No ; 'tis to thyself .

Come away .

There's the fool hangs on your back already .

No , thou stand'st single ; thou'rt not on him yet .

Where's the fool now ?

He last asked the question . Poor rogues , and usurers' men , bawds between gold and want !

What are we , Apemantus ?

Asses .

Why ?

That you ask me what you are , and do not know yourselves . Speak to 'em , fool .

How do you , gentlemen ?

Gramercies , good fool . How does your mistress ?

She's e'en setting on water to scald such chickens as you are . Would we could see you at Corinth !

Good , gramercy .


Look you , here comes my mistress' page .

Why , how now , captain , what do you in this wise company ? How dost thou , Apemantus ?

Would I had a rod in my mouth , that I might answer thee profitably .

Prithee , Apemantus , read me the superscription of these letters : I know not which is which .

Canst not read ?

No .

There will little learning die then that day thou art hanged . This is to Lord Timon ; this to Alcibiades . Go ; thou wast born a bastard , and thou'lt die a bawd .

Thou wast whelped a dog , and thou shalt famish a dog's death . Answer not ; I am gone .


E'en so thou outrunn'st grace .
Fool , I will go with you to Lord Timon's .

Will you leave me there ?

If Timon stay at home . You three serve three usurers ?

Ay ; would they served us !

So would I , as good a trick as ever hangman served thief .

Are you three usurers' men ?

Ay , fool .

I think no usurer but has a fool to his servant : my mistress is one , and I am her fool . When men come to borrow of your masters , they approach sadly , and go away merry ; but they enter my mistress' house merrily , and go away sadly : the reason of this ?

I could render one .

Do it , then , that we may account thee a whoremaster and a knave ; which , notwithstanding , thou shalt be no less esteemed .

What is a whoremaster , fool ?

A fool in good clothes , and something like thee . 'Tis a spirit : sometime 't appears like a lord ; sometime like a lawyer ; sometime like a philosopher , with two stones more than 's artificial one . He is very often like a knight ; and generally in all shapes that man goes up and down in from fourscore to thirteen , this spirit walks in .

Thou art not altogether a fool .

Nor thou altogether a wise man : as much foolery as I have , so much wit thou lackest .

That answer might have become Apemantus .

Aside , aside ; here comes Lord Timon .


Come with me , fool , come .

I do not always follow lover , elder brother and woman ; sometime the philosopher .


Pray you , walk near : I'll speak with you anon .


You make me marvel : wherefore , ere this time ,
Had you not fully laid my state before me ,
That I might so have rated my expense 
As I had leave of means ?

You would not hear me ,
At many leisures I propos'd .

Go to :
Perchance some single vantages you took ,
When my indisposition put you back ;
And that unaptness made your minister ,
Thus to excuse yourself .

O my good lord !
At many times I brought in my accounts ,
Laid them before you ; you would throw them off ,
And say you found them in mine honesty .
When for some trifling present you have bid me 
Return so much , I have shook my head , and wept ;
Yea , 'gainst the authority of manners , pray'd you 
To hold your hand more close : I did endure 
Not seldom , nor no slight checks , when I have 
Prompted you in the ebb of your estate 
And your great flow of debts . My loved lord ,
Though you hear now , too late , yet now's a time ,
The greatest of your having lacks a half 
To pay your present debts .

Let all my land be sold .

'Tis all engag'd , some forfeited and gone ;
And what remains will hardly stop the mouth 
Of present dues ; the future comes apace :
What shall defend the interim ? and at length 
How goes our reckoning ?

To Laced mon did my land extend .

O my good lord , the world is but a word ;
Were it all yours to give it in a breath ,
How quickly were it gone !

You tell me true .

If you suspect my husbandry or falsehood ,
Call me before the exactest auditors ,
And set me on the proof . So the gods bless me ,
When all our offices have been oppress'd 
With riotous feeders , when our vaults have wept 
With drunken spilth of wine , when every room 
Hath blaz'd with lights and bray'd with minstrelsy ,
I have retir'd me to a wasteful cock ,
And set mine eyes at flow .

Prithee , no more .

Heavens , have I said , the bounty of this lord !
How many prodigal bits have slaves and peasants 
This night englutted , Who is not Timon's ?
What heart , head , sword , force , means , but is Lord Timon's ?
Great Timon , noble , worthy , royal Timon !
Ah , when the means are gone that buy this praise ,
The breath is gone whereof this praise is made :
Feast-won , fast-lost ; one cloud of winter showers ,
These flies are couch'd .

Come , sermon me no further ;
No villanous bounty yet hath pass'd my heart ;
Unwisely , not ignobly , have I given .
Why dost thou weep ? Canst thou the conscience lack ,
To think I shall lack friends ? Secure thy heart ;
If I would broach the vessels of my love ,
And try the argument of hearts by borrowing ,
Men and men's fortunes could I frankly use 
As I can bid thee speak .

Assurance bless your thoughts !

And , in some sort , these wants of mine are crown'd ,
That I account them blessings ; for by these 
Shall I try friends . You shall perceive how you 
Mistake my fortunes ; I am wealthy in my friends .
Within there , Flaminius , Servilius !


My lord , my lord !

I will dispatch you severally : you , to Lord Lucius ; to Lord Lucullus you : I hunted with his honour to-day ; you , to Sempronius . Commend me to their loves ; and I am proud , say , that my occasions have found time to use them toward a supply of money : let the request be fifty talents .

As you have said , my lord .

Lord Lucius , and Lucullus ? hum !

Go you , sir , to the senators ,
Of whom , even to the state's best health , I have 
Deserv'd this hearing ,bid 'em send o' the instant 
A thousand talents to me .

I have been bold ,
For that I knew it the most general way ,
To them to use your signet and your name ;
But they do shake their heads , and I am here 
No richer in return .

Is't true ? can't be ?

They answer , in a joint and corporate voice ,
That now they are at fall , want treasure , cannot 
Do what they would ; are sorry ; you are honourable ;
But yet they could have wish'd ; they know not ;
Something hath been amiss ; a noble nature 
May catch a wrench ; would all were well ; 'tis pity ;
And so , intending other serious matters ,
After distasteful looks and these hard fractions ,
With certain half-caps and cold-moving nods 
They froze me into silence .

You gods , reward them !
Prithee , man , look cheerly . These old fellows 
Have their ingratitude in them hereditary ;
Their blood is cak'd , 'tis cold , it seldom flows ;
'Tis lack of kindly warmth they are not kind ;
And nature , as it grows again toward earth ,
Is fashion'd for the journey , dull and heavy .


Prithee , be not sad ,
Thou art true and honest ; ingenuously I speak ,
No blame belongs to thee .

Ventidius lately 
Buried his father ; by whose death he's stepp'd 
Into a great estate ; when he was poor ,
Imprison'd and in scarcity of friends ,
I clear'd him with five talents ; greet him from me ;
Bid him suppose some good necessity 
Touches his friend , which craves to be remember'd 
With those five talents .

That had , give't these fellows 
To whom 'tis instant due . Ne'er speak , or think 
That Timon's fortunes 'mong his friends can sink .

I would I could not think it : that thought is bounty's foe ;
Being free itself , it thinks all others so .

I have told my lord of you ; he is coming down to you .

I thank you , sir .


Here's my lord .

One of Lord Timon's men , a gift , I warrant . Why , this hits right ; I dreamt of a silver bason and ewer to-night . Flaminius , honest Flaminius , you are very respectively welcome , sir . Fill me some wine . [Exit Servant .] And how does that honourable , complete , free-hearted gentleman of Athens , thy very bountiful good lord and master ?

His health is well , sir .

I am right glad that his health is well , sir . And what hast thou there under thy cloak , pretty Flaminius ?

Faith , nothing but an empty box , sir ; which , in my lord's behalf , I come to entreat your honour to supply ; who , having great and instant occasion to use fifty talents , hath sent to your lordship to furnish him , nothing doubting your present assistance therein .

La , la , la , la , 'nothing doubting ,' says he ? Alas , good lord ; a noble gentleman 'tis , if he would not keep so good a house . Many a time and often I ha' dined with him , and told him on't ; and come again to supper to him , of purpose to have him spend less ; and yet he would embrace no counsel , take no warning by my coming . Every man has his fault , and honesty is his ; I ha' told him on't , but I could ne'er get him from it .


Please your lordship , here is the wine .

Flaminius , I have noted thee always wise . Here's to thee .

Your lordship speaks your pleasure .

I have observed thee always for a towardly prompt spirit , give thee thy due , and one that knows what belongs to reason ; and canst use the time well , if the time use thee well : good parts in thee .

Get you gone , sirrah .[Exit Servant .] Draw nearer , honest Flaminius . Thy lord's a bountiful gentleman ; but thou art wise , and thou knowest well enough , although thou comest to me , that this is no time to lend money , especially upon bare friendship , without security . Here's three solidares for thee : good boy , wink at me , and say thou sawest me not . Fare thee well .

Is't possible the world should so much differ ,
And we alive that liv'd ? Fly , damned baseness ,
To him that worships thee .


Ha , now I see thou art a fool , and fit for thy master .


May these add to the number that may scald thee !
Let molten coin be thy damnation ,
Thou disease of a friend , and not himself !
Has friendship such a faint and milky heart 
It turns in less than two nights ? O you gods !
I feel my master's passion . This slave unto his honour 
Has my lord's meat in him :
Why should it thrive and turn to nutriment 
When he is turn'd to poison ?
O , may diseases only work upon 't ,
And , when he's sick to death , let not that part of nature 
Which my lord paid for , be of any power 
To expel sickness , but prolong his hour .


Who , the Lord Timon ? he is my very good friend , and an honourable gentleman .

We know him for no less , though we are but strangers to him . But I can tell you one thing , my lord , and which I hear from common rumours : now Lord Timon's happy hours are done and past , and his estate shrinks from him .

Fie , no , do not believe it ; he cannot want for money .

But believe you this , my lord , that , not long ago , one of his men was with the Lord Lucullus , to borrow so many talents , nay , urged extremely for 't , and showed what necessity belonged to 't , and yet was denied .

How !

I tell you , denied , my lord .

What a strange case was that , now , before the gods , I am ashamed on 't . Denied that honourable man , there was very little honour showed in 't . For my own part , I must needs confess , I have received some small kindnesses from him , as money , plate , jewels , and such like trifles , nothing comparing to his ; yet , had he mistook him , and sent to me , I should ne'er have denied his occasion so many talents .


See , by good hap , yonder's my lord ; I have sweat to see his honour .

My honoured lord !

Servilius , you are kindly met , sir . Fare thee well : commend me to thy honourable virtuous lord , my very exquisite friend .

May it please your honour , my lord hath sent 

Ha , what has he sent ? I am so much endeared to that lord ; he's ever sending : how shall I thank him , thinkest thou ? And what has he sent now ?

He has only sent his present occasion now , my lord ; requesting your lordship to supply his instant use with so many talents .

I know his lordship is but merry with me ;
He cannot want fifty-five hundred talents .

But in the mean time he wants less , my lord .
If his occasion were not virtuous ,
I should not urge it half so faithfully .

Dost thou speak seriously , Servilius ?

Upon my soul , 'tis true , sir .

What a wicked beast was I to disfurnish myself against such a good time , when I might ha' shown myself honourable , how unluckily it happened , that I should purchase the day before for a little part , and undo a great deal of honour , Servilius , now , before the gods , I am not able to do ; the more beast , I say ; I was sending to use Lord Timon myself , these gentlemen can witness ; but I would not , for the wealth of Athens , I had done it now . Commend me bountifully to his good lordship ; and I hope his honour will conceive the fairest of me , because I have no power to be kind : and tell him this from me , I count it one of my greatest afflictions say , that I cannot pleasure such an honourable gentleman . Good Servilius , will you befriend me so far as to use mine own words to him ?

Yes , sir , I shall .

I'll look you out a good turn , Servilius .

True , as you said , Timon is shrunk indeed ;
And he that's once denied will hardly speed .


Do you observe this , Hostilius ?

Ay , too well .

Why this is the world's soul ; and just of the same piece 
Is every flatterer's spirit . Who can call him 
His friend that dips in the same dish ? for , in 
My knowing , Timon has been this lord's father ,
And kept his credit with his purse ,
Supported his estate ; nay , Timon's money 
Has paid his men their wages : he ne'er drinks 
But Timon's silver treads upon his lip ;
And yet , O , see the monstrousness of man ,
When he looks out in an ungrateful shape ,
He does deny him , in respect of his ,
What charitable men afford to beggars .

Religion groans at it .

For mine own part ,
I never tasted Timon in my life ,
Nor came any of his bounties over me ,
To mark me for his friend ; yet , I protest ,
For his right noble mind , illustrious virtue ,
And honourable carriage ,
Had his necessity made use of me ,
I would have put my wealth into donation ,
And the best half should have return'd to him ,
So much I love his heart . But , I perceive ,
Men must learn now with pity to dispense ;
For policy sits above conscience .


Must he needs trouble me in 't . Hum , 'bove all others ?
He might have tried Lord Lucius , or Lucullus ;
And now Ventidius is wealthy too ,
Whom he redeem'd from prison : all these 
Owe their estates unto him .

My lord ,
They have all been touch'd and found base metal , for 
They have all denied him .

How , have they denied him ?
Have Ventidius and Lucullus denied him ?
And does he send to me ? Three ? hum !
It shows but little love or judgment in him :
Must I be his last refuge ? His friends , like physicians ,
Thrice give him over ; must I take the cure upon me ?
He has much disgrac'd me in 't ; I'm angry at him ,
That might have known my place . I see no sense for 't ,
But his occasions might have woo'd me first ;
For , in my conscience , I was the first man 
That e'er received gift from him :
And does he think so backwardly of me now ,
That I'll requite it last ? No :
So it may prove an argument of laughter 
To the rest , and I 'mongst lords be thought a fool .
I had rather than the worth of thrice the sum ,
He had sent to me first , but for my mind's sake ;
I'd such a courage to do him good . But now return ,
And with their faint reply this answer join ;
Who bates mine honour shall not know my coin .


Excellent , Your lordship's a goodly villain . The devil knew not what he did when he made man politic ; he crossed himself by 't : and I cannot think but in the end the villanies of man will set him clear . How fairly this lord strives to appear foul , takes virtuous copies to be wicked , like those that under hot ardent zeal would set whole realms on fire :
Of such a nature is his politic love .
This was my lord's best hope ; now all are fled 
Save only the gods . Now his friends are dead ,
Doors , that were ne'er acquainted with their wards 
Many a bounteous year , must be employ'd 
Now to guard sure their master :
And this is all a liberal course allows ;
Who cannot keep his wealth must keep his house .

Well met ; good morrow , Titus and Hortensius .

The like to you , kind Varro .

Lucius !
What , do we meet together !

Ay , and I think 
One business does command us all ; for mine 
Is money .

So is theirs and ours .


And Sir Philotus too !

Good day at once .

Welcome , good brother .
What do you think the hour ?

Labouring for nine .

So much ?

Is not my lord seen yet ?

Not yet .

I wonder on 't ; he was wont to shine at seven .

Ay , but the days are waxed shorter with him :
You must consider that a prodigal course 
Is like the sun's ; but not , like his , recoverable .
I fear ,
'Tis deepest winter in Lord Timon's purse ;
That is , one may reach deep enough , and yet 
Find little .

I am of your fear for that .

I'll show you how to observe a strange event .
Your lord sends now for money .

Most true , he does .

And he wears jewels now of Timon's gift ,
For which I wait for money .

It is against my heart .

Mark , how strange it shows ,
Timon in this should pay more than he owes :
And e'en as if your lord should wear rich jewels ,
And send for money for 'em .

I'm weary of this charge , the gods can witness :
I know my lord hath spent of Timon's wealth ,
And now ingratitude makes it worse than stealth .

Yes , mine's three thousand crowns ; what's yours ?

Five thousand mine .

'Tis much deep : and it should seem by the sum ,
Your master's confidence was above mine ;
Else , surely , his had equall'd .


One of Lord Timon's men .

Flaminius , Sir , a word . Pray , is my lord ready to come forth ?

No , indeed , he is not .

We attend his lordship ; pray , signify so much .

I need not tell him that ; he knows you are too diligent .

Ha , is not that his steward muffled so ?
He goes away in a cloud : call him , call him .

Do you hear , sir ?

By your leave , sir .

What do you ask of me , my friend ?

We wait for certain money here , sir .

Ay ,
If money were as certain as your waiting ,
'Twere sure enough .
Why then preferr'd you not your sums and bills ,
When your false masters eat of my lord's meat ?
Then they could smile and fawn upon his debts ,
And take down the interest into their gluttonous maws .
You do yourselves but wrong to stir me up ;
Let me pass quietly :
Believe't , my lord and I have made an end ;
I have no more to reckon , he to spend .

Ay , but this answer will not serve .

If 'twill not serve , 'tis not so base as you ;
For you serve knaves .


How , what does his cashiered worship mutter ?

No matter what ; he's poor , and that's revenge enough . Who can speak broader than he that has no house to put his head in ? such may rail against great buildings .


O , here's Servilius ; now we shall know some answer .

If I might beseech you , gentlemen , to repair some other hour , I should derive much from 't ; for , take 't of my soul , my lord leans wondrously to discontent . His comfortable temper has forsook him ; he's much out of health , and keeps his chamber .

Many do keep their chambers are not sick :
And , if it be so far beyond his health ,
Methinks he should the sooner pay his debts ,
And make a clear way to the gods .

Good gods !

We cannot take this for answer , sir .

Servilius , help , my lord , my lord !


What , are my doors oppos'd against my passage ?
Have I been ever free , and must my house 
Be my retentive enemy , my gaol ?
The place which I have feasted , does it now ,
Like all mankind , show me an iron heart ?

Put in now , Titus .

My lord , here is my bill .

Here's mine .

And mine , my lord .

And ours , my lord .

All our bills .

Knock me down with 'em : cleave me to the girdle .

Alas , my lord ,

Cut my heart in sums .

Mine , fifty talents .

Tell out my blood .

Five thousand crowns , my lord .

Five thousand drops pays that . What yours ? and yours ?

My lord ,

My lord ,

Tear me , take me ; and the gods fall upon you !


Faith , I perceive our masters may throw their caps at their money : these debts may well be called desperate ones , for a madman owes 'em .

They have e'en put my breath from me , the slaves :
Creditors ? devils !

My dear lord ,

What if it should be so ?

My lord ,

I'll have it so . My steward !

Here , my lord .

So fitly , Go , bid all my friends again ,
Lucius , Lucullus , and Sempronius ; all :
I'll once more feast the rascals .

O my lord !
You only speak from your distracted soul ;
There is not so much left to furnish out 
A moderate table .

Be't not in thy care : go .
I charge thee , invite them all : let in the tide 
Of knaves once more ; my cook and I'll provide .


My lord , you have my voice to it ; the fault's 
Bloody ; 'tis necessary he should die ;
Nothing emboldens sin so much as mercy .

Most true ; the law shall bruise him .


Honour , health , and compassion to the senate !

Now , captain .

I am a humble suitor to your virtues ;
For pity is the virtue of the law ,
And none but tyrants use it cruelly .
It pleases time and fortune to lie heavy 
Upon a friend of mine , who , in hot blood ,
Hath stepp'd into the law , which is past depth 
To those that without heed to plunge into 't .
He is a man , setting his fate aside ,
Of comely virtues ;
Nor did he soil the fact with cowardice ,
An honour in him which buys out his fault ,
But , with a noble fury and fair spirit ,
Seeing his reputation touch'd to death ,
He did oppose his foe ;
And with such sober and unnoted passion 
He did behave his anger , ere 'twas spent ,
As if he had but prov'd an argument .

You undergo too strict a paradox ,
Striving to make an ugly deed look fair :
Your words have took such pains as if they labour'd 
To bring manslaughter into form , and set quarrelling 
Upon the head of valour ; which indeed 
Is valour misbegot , and came into the world 
When sects and factions were newly born .
He's truly valiant that can wisely suffer 
The worst that man can breathe , and make his wrongs 
His outsides , to wear them like his raiment , carelessly ,
And ne'er prefer his injuries to his heart ,
To bring it into danger .
If wrongs be evils and enforce us kill ,
What folly 'tis to hazard life for ill !

My lord ,

You cannot make gross sins look clear ;
To revenge is no valour , but to bear .

My lords , then , under favour , pardon me ,
If I speak like a captain .
Why do fond men expose themselves to battle ,
And not endure all threats ? sleep upon't ,
And let the foes quietly cut their throats 
Without repugnancy ? If there be 
Such valour in the bearing , what make we 
Abroad ? why then , women are more valiant 
That stay at home , if bearing carry it ,
And the ass more captain than the lion , the felon 
Loaden with irons wiser than the judge ,
If wisdom be in suffering . O my lords !
As you are great , be pitifully good :
Who cannot condemn rashness in cold blood ?
To kill , I grant , is sin's extremest gust ;
But , in defence , by mercy , 'tis most just .
To be in anger is impiety ;
But who is man that is not angry ?
Weigh but the crime with this .

You breathe in vain .

In vain , his service done 
At Laced mon and Byzantium 
Were a sufficient briber for his life .

What's that ?

I say , my lords , he has done fair service ,
And slain in fight many of your enemies .
How full of valour did he bear himself 
In the last conflict , and made plenteous wounds !

He has made too much plenty with 'em ;
He's a sworn rioter ; he has a sin that often 
Drowns him and takes his valour prisoner ;
If there were no foes , that were enough 
To overcome him ; in that beastly fury 
He has been known to commit outrages 
And cherish factions ; 'tis inferr'd to us ,
His days are foul and his drink dangerous .

He dies .

Hard fate , he might have died in war .
My lords , if not for any parts in him ,
Though his right arm might purchase his own time ,
And be in debt to none ,yet , more to move you ,
Take my deserts to his , and join 'em both ;
And , for I know your reverend ages love 
Security , I'll pawn my victories , all 
My honour to you , upon his good returns .
If by this crime he owes the law his life ,
Why , let the war receive't in valiant gore ;
For law is strict , and war is nothing more .

We are for law ; he dies : urge it no more ,
On height of our displeasure . Friend , or brother ,
He forfeits his own blood that spills another .

Must it be so ? it must not be . My lords ,
I do beseech you , know me .

How !

Call me to your remembrances .

What !

I cannot think but your age has forgot me ;
It could not else be I should prove so base ,
To sue , and be denied such common grace .
My wounds ache at you .

Do you dare our anger ?
'Tis in few words , but spacious in effect ;
We banish thee for ever .

Banish me !
Banish your dotage ; banish usury ,
That makes the senate ugly .

If , after two days' shine , Athens contain thee ,
Attend our weightier judgment . And , not to swell our spirit ,
He shall be executed presently .


Now the gods keep you old enough ; that you may live 
Only in bone , that none may look on you !
I am worse than mad : I have kept back their foes ,
While they have told their money and let out 
Their coin upon large interest ; I myself 
Rich only in large hurts : all those for this ?
Is this the balsam that the usuring senate 
Pours into captains' wounds ? Banishment !
It comes not ill ; I hate not to be banish'd ;
It is a cause worthy my spleen and fury ,
That I may strike at Athens . I'll cheer up 
My discontented troops , and lay for hearts .
'Tis honour with most lands to be at odds ;
Soldiers should brook as little wrongs as gods .

The good time of day to you , sir .

I also wish it you . I think this honourable lord did but try us this other day .

Upon that were my thoughts tiring when we encountered : I hope it is not so low with him as he made it seem in the trial of his several friends .

It should not be , by the persuasion of his new feasting .

I should think so : he hath sent me an earnest inviting , which many my near occasions did urge me to put off ; but he hath conjured me beyond them , and I must needs appear .

In like manner was I in debt to my importunate business , but he would not hear my excuse . I am sorry , when he sent to borrow of me , that my provision was out .

I am sick of that grief too , as I understand how all things go .

Every man here's so . What would he have borrowed you ?

A thousand pieces .

A thousand pieces !

What of you ?

He sent to me , sir ,Here he comes .


With all my heart , gentlemen both ; and how fare you ?

Ever at the best , hearing well of your lordship .

The swallow follows not summer more willing than we your lordship .

Nor more willingly leaves winter ; such summer-birds are men . Gentlemen , our dinner will not recompense this long stay : feast your ears with the music awhile , if they will fare so harshly o' the trumpet's sound ; we shall to 't presently .

I hope it remains not unkindly with your lordship that I returned you an empty messenger .

O , sir , let it not trouble you .

My noble lord ,

Ah , my good friend , what cheer ?

My most honourable lord , I am e'en sick of shame , that when your lordship this other day sent to me I was so unfortunate a beggar .

Think not on 't , sir .

If you had sent but two hours before ,

Let it not cumber your better remembrance .

Come , bring in all together .

All covered dishes !

Royal cheer , I warrant you .

Doubt not that , if money and the season can yield it .

How do you ? What's the news ?

Alcibiades is banished : hear you of it ?

Alcibiades banished !

Alcibiades banished !

'Tis so , be sure of it .

How ? how ?

I pray you , upon what ?

My worthy friends , will you draw near ?

I'll tell you more anon . Here's a noble feast toward .

This is the old man still .

Will't hold ? will't hold ?

It does ; but time will and so 

I do conceive .

Each man to his stool , with that spur as he would to the lip of his mistress ; your diet shall be in all places alike . Make not a city feast of it , to let the meat cool ere we can agree upon the first place : sit , sit . The gods require our thanks .
You great benefactors sprinkle our society with thankfulness . For your own gifts , make yourselves praised : but reserve still to give , lest your deities be despised . Lend to each man enough , that one need not lend to another ; for , were your godheads to borrow of men , men would forsake the gods . Make the meat be beloved more than the man that gives it . Let no assembly of twenty be without a score of villains : if there sit twelve women at the table , let a dozen of them be as they are . The rest of your fees , O gods , the senators of Athens , together with the common lag of people , what is amiss in them , you gods , make suitable for destruction . For these my present friends , as they are to me nothing , so in nothing bless them , and to nothing are they welcome .
Uncover , dogs , and lap .


What does his lordship mean ?

I know not .

May you a better feast never behold ,
You knot of mouth-friends , smoke and lukewarm water 
Is your perfection . This is Timon's last ;
Who , stuck and spangled with your flatteries ,
Washes it off , and sprinkles in your faces 

Your reeking villany . Live loath'd , and long ,
Most smiling , smooth , detested parasites ,
Courteous destroyers , affable wolves , meek bears ,
You fools of fortune , trencher-friends , time's flies ,
Cap and knee slaves , vapours , and minute-jacks !
Of man and beast the infinite malady 
Crust you quite o'er , What , dost thou go ?
Soft , take thy physic first ,thou too ,and thou ;
Stay , I will lend thee money , borrow none .

What , all in motion ? Henceforth be no feast ,
Whereat a villain's not a welcome guest .
Burn , house , sink , Athens , henceforth hated be 
Of Timon man and all humanity !

How now , my lords !

Know you the quality of Lord Timon's fury ?

Push , did you see my cap ?

I have lost my gown .

He's but a mad lord , and nought but humour sways him . He gave me a jewel th' other day , and now he has beat it out of my hat : did you see my jewel ?

Did you see my cap ?

Here 'tis .

Here lies my gown .

Let's make no stay .

Lord Timon's mad .

I feel 't upon my bones .

One day he gives us diamonds , next day stones .

Let me look back upon thee . O thou wall ,
That girdlest in those wolves , dive in the earth .
And fence not Athens , Matrons , turn incontinent !
Obedience fail in children , slaves and fools ,
Pluck the grave wrinkled senate from the bench ,
And minister in their steads , To general filths 
Convert , o'the instant , green virginity !
Do't in your parents' eyes , Bankrupts , hold fast ;
Rather than render back , out with your knives ,
And cut your trusters' throats , Bound servants , steal !
Large-handed robbers your grave masters are ,
And pill by law . Maid , to thy master's bed ;
Thy mistress is o' the brothel , Son of sixteen ,
Pluck the lin'd crutch from thy old limping sire ,
With it beat out his brains , Piety , and fear ,
Religion to the gods , peace , justice , truth ,
Domestic awe , night-rest and neighbourhood ,
Instruction , manners , mysteries and trades ,
Degrees , observances , customs and laws ,
Decline to your confounding contraries ,
And let confusion live , Plagues incident to men ,
Your potent and infectious fevers heap 
On Athens , ripe for stroke , Thou cold sciatica ,
Cripple our senators , that their limbs may halt 
As lamely as their manners , Lust and liberty 
Creep in the minds and marrows of our youth ,
That'gainst the stream of virtue they may strive ,
And drown themselves in riot , Itches , blains ,
Sow all the Athenian bosoms , and their crop 
Be general leprosy , Breath infect breath ,
That their society , as their friendship , may 
Be merely poison , Nothing I'll bear from thee 
But nakedness , thou detestable town !
Take thou that too , with multiplying bans !
Timon will to the woods ; where he shall find 
The unkindest beast more kinder than mankind .
The gods confound hear me , you good gods all 
The Athenians both within and out that wall !
And grant , as Timon grows , his hate may grow 
To the whole race of mankind , high and low !
Amen .


Hear you , Master steward , where's our master ?
Are we undone ? cast off ? nothing remaining ?

Alack , my fellows , what should I say to you ?
Let me be recorded by the righteous gods ,
I am as poor as you .

Such a house broke !
So noble a master fall'n , All gone , and not 
One friend to take his fortune by the arm ,
And go along with him !

As we do turn our backs 
From our companion thrown into his grave ,
So his familiars to his buried fortunes 
Slink all away , leave their false vows with him ,
Like empty purses pick'd ; and his poor self ,
A dedicated beggar to the air ,
With his disease of all-shunn'd poverty ,
Walks , like contempt , alone . More of our fellows .


All broken implements of a ruin'd house .

Yet do our hearts wear Timon's livery ,
That see I by our faces ; we are fellows still ,
Serving alike in sorrow . Leak'd is our bark ,
And we , poor mates , stand on the dying deck ,
Hearing the surges threat : we must all part 
Into this sea of air .

Good fellows all ,
The latest of my wealth I'll share amongst you .
Wherever we shall meet , for Timon's sake 
Let's yet be fellows ; let's shake our heads , and say ,
As 'twere a knell unto our master's fortunes ,
'We have seen better days .' Let each take some ;

Nay , put out all your hands . Not one word more :
Thus part we rich in sorrow , parting poor .

O , the fierce wretchedness that glory brings us .
Who would not wish to be from wealth exempt ,
Since riches point to misery and contempt ?
Who would be so mock'd with glory ? or so live ,
But in a dream of friendship ?
To have his pomp and all what state compounds 
But only painted , like his varnish'd friends ?
Poor honest lord , brought low by his own heart ,
Undone by goodness . Strange , unusual blood ,
When man's worst sin is he does too much good !
Who then dares to be half so kind agen ?
For bounty , that makes gods , does still mar men .
My dearest lord , bless'd , to be most accurs'd ,
Rich , only to be wretched , thy great fortunes 
Are made thy chief affictions . Alas , kind lord ,
He's flung in rage from this ingrateful seat 
Of monstrous friends ;
Nor has he with him to supply his life ,
Or that which can command it .
I'll follow and inquire him out :
I'll ever serve his mind with my best will ;
Whilst I have gold I'll be his steward still .


O blessed breeding sun , draw from the earth 
Rotten humidity ; below thy sister's orb 
Infect the air , Twinn'd brothers of one womb ,
Whose procreation , residence and birth ,
Scarce is dividant , touch them with several fortunes ;
The greater scorns the lesser : not nature ,
To whom all sores lay siege , can bear great fortune ,
But by contempt of nature .
Raise me this beggar , and deny't that lord ;
The senator shall bear contempt hereditary ,
The beggar native honour .
It is the pasture lards the rother's sides ,
The want that makes him lean . Who dares , who dares ,
In purity of manhood stand upright ,
And say , 'This man's a flatterer ?' if one be ,
So are they all ; for every grize of fortune 
Is smooth'd by that below : the learned pate 
Ducks to the golden fool : all is oblique ;
There's nothing level in our cursed natures 
But direct villany . Therefore , be abhorr'd 
All feasts , societies , and throngs of men !
His semblable , yea , himself , Timon disdains :
Destruction fang mankind , Earth , yield me roots !

Who seeks for better of thee , sauce his palate 
With thy most operant poison , What is here ?
Gold , yellow , glittering , precious gold , No , gods ,
I am no idle votarist . Roots , you clear heavens !
Thus much of this will make black white , foul fair ,
Wrong right , base noble , old young , coward valiant .
Ha , you gods , why this ? What this , you gods ? Why , this 
Will lug your priests and servants from your sides ,
Pluck stout men's pillows from below their head :
This yellow slave 
Will knit and breah religions ; bless the accurs'd ;
Make the hoar leprosy ador'd ; place thieves ,
And give them title , knee , and approbation ,
With senators on the bench ; this is it 
That makes the wappen'd widow wed again ;
She , whom the spital-house and ulcerous sores 
Would cast the gorge at , this embalms and spices 
To the April day again . Come , damned earth ,
Thou common whore of mankind , that putt'st odds 
Among the rout of nations , I will make thee 
Do thy right nature .

Ha , a drum ? thou'rt quick ,
But yet I'll bury thee : thou'lt go , strong theif ,
When gouty keepers of thee cannot stand :
Nay , stay thou out for earnest .

What art thou there ? speak .

A beast , as thou art . The canker gnaw thy heart ,
For showing me again the eyes of man !

What is thy name ? Is man so hateful to thee ,
That art thyself a man ?

I am Misanthropos , and hate mankind .
For thy part , I do wish thou wert a dog ,
That I might love thee something .

I know thee well ,
But in thy fortunes am unlearn'd and strange .

I know thee too ; and more than that I know thee 
I not desire to know . Follow thy drum ;
With man's blood paint the ground , gules , gules ;
Religious canons , civil laws are cruel ;
Then what should war be ? This fell whore of thine 
Hath in her more destruction than thy sword 
For all her cherubin look .

Thy lips rot off !

I will not kiss thee ; then the rot returns 
To thine own lips again .

How came the noble Timon to this change ?

As the moon does , by wanting light to give :
But then renew I could not like the moon ;
There were no suns to borrow of .

Noble Timon , what friendship may I do thee ?

None , but to maintain my opinion .

What is it , Timon ?

Promise me friendship , but perform none : if thou wilt not promise , the gods plague thee , for thou art a man , if thou dost perform , confound thee , for thou art a man !

I have heard in some sort of thy miseries .

Thou saw'st them , when I had prosperity .

I see them now ; then was a blessed time .

As thine is now , held with a brace of harlots .

Is this the Athenian minion , whom the world 
Voic'd so regardfully ?

Art thou Timandra ?

Yes .

Be a whore still ; they love thee not that use thee ;
Give them diseases , leaving with thee their lust .
Make use of thy salt hours ; season the slaves 
For tubs and baths ; bring down rose-cheeked youth 
To the tub-fast and the diet .

Hang thee , monster !

Pardon him , sweet Timandra , for his wits 
Are drown'd and lost in his calamities .
I have but little gold of late , brave Timon ,
The want whereof doth daily make revolt 
In my penurious band : I have heard and griev'd 
How cursed Athens , mindless of thy worth ,
Forgetting thy great deeds , when neighbour states ,
But for thy sword and fortune , trod upon them ,

I prithee , beat thy drum , and get thee gone .

I am thy friend , and pity thee , dear Timon .

How dost thou pity him whom thou dost trouble ?
I had rather be alone .

Why , fare thee well :
Here is some gold for thee .

Keep it , I cannot eat it .

When I have laid proud Athens on a heap ,

Warr'st thou 'gainst Athens ?

Ay , Timon , and have cause .

The gods confound them all in thy conquest ; and 
Thee after , when thou hast conquer'd !

Why me , Timon ?

That , by killing of villains , thou wast born to conquer 
My country .
Put up thy gold : go on ,here's gold ,go on ;
Be as a planetary plague , when Jove 
Will o'er some high-vic'd city hang his poison 
In the sick air : let not thy sword skip one .
Pity not honour'd age for his white beard ;
He is a usurer . Strike me the counterfeit matron ;
It is her habit only that is honest ,
Herself's a bawd . Let not the virgin's cheek 
Make soft thy trenchant sword ; for those milkpaps ,
That through the window-bars bore at men's eyes ,
Are not within the leaf of pity writ ,
But set them down horrible traitors . Spare not the babe ,
Whose dimpled smiles from fools exhaust their mercy ;
Think it a bastard , whom the oracle 
Hath doubtfully pronounc'd thy throat shall cut ,
And mince it sans remorse . Swear against objects ;
Put armour on thine ears and on thine eyes ,
Whose proof nor yells of mothers , maids , nor babes ,
Nor sight of priests in holy vestments bleeding ,
Shall pierce a jot . There's gold to pay thy soldiers :
Make large confusion ; and , thy fury spent ,
Confounded be thyself , Speak not , be gone .

Hast thou gold yet ? I'll take the gold thou giv'st me ,
Not all thy counsel .

Dost thou , or dost thou not , heaven's curse upon thee !

Give us some gold , good Timon : hast thou more ?

Give us some gold , good Timon : hast thou more ?

Enough to make a whore forswear her trade ,
And to make whores a bawd . Hold up , you sluts ,
Your aprons mountant : you are not oathable ,
Although , I know , you'll swear , terribly swear 
Into strong shudders and to heavenly agues 
The immortal gods that hear you , spare your oaths ,
I'll trust to your conditions : be whores still ;
And he whose pious breath seeks to convert you ,
Be strong in whore , allure him , burn him up ;
Let your close fire predominate his smoke ,
And be no turncoats : yet may your pains , six months ,
Be quite contrary : and thatch your poor thin roofs 
With burdens of the dead ; some that were hang'd ,
No matter ; wear them , betray with them : whore still ;
Paint till a horse may mire upon your face :
A pox of wrinkles !

Well , more gold . What then ?

Well , more gold . What then ?
Believe't , that we'll do anything for gold .

Consumptions sow 
In hollow bones of man ; strike their sharp shins ,
And mar men's spurring . Crack the lawyer's voice ,
That he may never more false title plead ,
Nor sound his quillets shrilly : hoar the flamen ,
That scolds against the quality of flesh ,
And not believes himself : down with the nose ,
Down with it flat ; take the bridge quite away 
Of him that , his particular to foresee ,
Smells from the general weal : make curl'd-pate ruffians bald ,
And let the unscarr'd braggarts of the war 
Derive some pain from you : plague all ,
That your activity may defeat and quell 
The source of all erection . There's more gold ;
Do you damn others , and let this damn you ,
And ditches grave you all !

More counsel with more money , bounteous Timon .

More counsel with more money , bounteous Timon .

More whore , more mischief first ; I have given you earnest .

Strike up the drum towards Athens , Farewell , Timon :
If I thrive well , I'll visit thee again .

If I hope well , I'll never see thee more .

I never did thee harm .

Yes , thou spok'st well of me .

Call'st thou that harm ?

Men daily find it . Get thee away , and take 
Thy beagles with thee .

We but offend him . Strike !


That nature , being sick of man's unkindness ,
Should yet be hungry , Common mother , thou ,

Whose womb unmeasurable , and infinite breast ,
Teams , and feeds all ; whose self-same mettle ,
Whereof thy proud child , arrogant man , is puff'd ,
Engenders the black toad and adder blue ,
The gilded newt and eyeless venom'd worm ,
With all the abhorred births below crisp heaven 
Whareon Hyperion's quickening fire doth shine ;
Yield him , who all thy human sons doth hate ,
From forth thy plenteous bosom , one poor root !
Ensear thy fertile and conceptious womb ,
Let it no more bring out ingrateful man !
Go great with tigers , dragons , wolves , and bears ;
Teem with new monsters , whom thy upward face 
Hath to the marbled mansion all above 
Never presented , O , a root ; dear thanks :
Dry up thy marrows , vines and plough-torn leas ;
Whereof ingrateful man , with liquorish draughts 
And morsels unctuous , greases his pure mind ,
That from it all consideration slips !

More man , Plague , plague !

I was directed hither : men report 
Thou dost affect my manners , and dost use them .

'Tis , then , because thou dost not keep a dog 
Whom I would imitate : consumption catch thee !

This is in thee a nature but infected ;
A poor unmanly melancholy sprung 
From change of fortune . Why this spade ? this place ?
This slave-like habit ? and these looks of care ?
Thy flatterers yet wear silk , drink wine , lie soft ,
Hug their diseas'd perfumes , and have forgot 
That ever Timon was . Shame not these woods 
By putting on the cunning of a carper .
Be thou a flatterer now , and seak to thrive 
By that which has undone thee : hinge thy knee ,
And let his very breath , whom thou'lt observe ,
Blow off thy cap ; praise his most vicious strain ,
And call it excellent . Thou wast told thus ;
Thou gav'st thine ears , like tapsters that bid welcome ,
To knaves and all approachers : 'tis most just 
That thou turn rascal ; hadst thou wealth again ,
Rascals should have't . Do not assume my likeness .

Were I like thee I'd throw away myself .

Thou hast cast away thyself , being like thyself ;
A madman so long , now a fool . What , think'st 
That the bleak air , thy boisterous chamberlain ,
Will put thy shirt on warm ? will these moss'd trees ,
That have outliv'd the eagle , page thy heels 
And skip when thou point'st out ? will the cold brook ,
Candied with ice , caudle thy morning taste 
To cure the o'er-night's surfeit ? Call the creatures 
Whose naked natures live in all the spite 
Of wreakful heaven , whose bare unhoused trunks 
To the conflicting elements expos'd ,
Answer mere nature ; bid them flatter thee ;
O , thou shalt find 

A fool of thee . Depart .

I love thee better now than e'er I did .

I hate thee worse .

Why ?

Thou flatter'st misery .

I flatter not , but say thou art a caitiff .

Why dost thou seek me out ?

To vex thee .

Always a villain's office , or a fool's .
Dost please thyself in 't ?

Ay .

What , a knave too ?

If thou didst put this sour-cold habit on 
To castigate thy pride , 'twere well ; but thou 
Dost it enforcedly ; thou'dst courtier be again 
Wert thou not beggar . Willing misery 
Outlives incertain pomp , is crown'd before ;
The one is filling still , never complete ;
The other , at high wish : best state , contentless ,
Hath a distracted and most wretched being ,
Worse than the worst , content .
Thou shouldst desire to die , being miserable .

Not by his breath that is more miserable .
Thou art a slave , whom Fortune's tender arm 
With favour never clasp'd , but bred a dog .
Hadst thou , like us from our first swath , proceeded 
The sweet degrees that this brief world affords 
To such as may the passive drudges of it 
Freely command , thou wouldst have plung'd thyself 
In general riot ; melted down thy youth 
In different beds of lust ; and never learn'd 
The icy precepts of respect , but follow'd 
The sugar'd game before thee . But myself ,
Who had the world as my confectionary ,
The mouths , the tongues , the eyes , and hearts of men 
At duty , more than I could frame employment ,
That numberless upon me stuck as leaves 
Do on the oak , have with one winter's brush 
Fell from their boughs and left me open , bare 
For every storm that blows ; I , to bear this ,
That never knew but better , is some burden :
Thy nature did commence in sufferance , time 
Hath made thee hard in 't . Why shouldst thou hate men ?
They never flatter'd thee : what hast thou given ?
If thou wilt curse , thy father , that poor rag ,
Must be thy subject , who in spite put stuff 
To some she beggar and compounded thee 
Poor rogue hereditary . Hence , be gone !
If thou hadst not been born the worst of men ,
Thou hadst been a knave and flatterer .

Art thou proud yet ?

Ay , that I am not thee .

I , that I was 
No prodigal .

I , that I am one now :
Were all the wealth I have shut up in thee ,
I'd give thee leave to hang it . Get thee gone .
That the whole life of Athens were in this !
Thus would I eat it .


Here ; I will mend thy feast .

First mend my company , take away thyself .

So I shall mend mine own , by the lack of thine .

'Tis not well mended so , it is but botch'd ;
If not , I would it were .

What wouldst thou have to Athens ?

Thee thither in a whirlwind . If thou wilt ,
Tell them there I have gold ; look , so I have .

Here is no use for gold .

The best and truest ;
For here it sleeps , and does no hired harm .

Where liest o' nights , Timon ?

Under that's above me .
Where feed'st thou o' days , Apemantus ?

Where my stomach finds meat ; or , rather , where I eat it .

Would poison were obedient and knew my mind !

Where wouldst thou send it ?

To sauce thy dishes .

The middle of humanity thou never knewest , but the extremity of both ends . When thou wast in thy gilt and thy perfume , they mocked thee for too much curiosity ; in thy rags thou knowest none , but art despised for the contrary . There's a medlar for thee ; eat it .

On what I hate I feed not .

Dost hate a medlar ?

Ay , though it look like thee .

An thou hadst hated meddlers sooner , thou shouldst have loved thyself better now . What man didst thou ever know unthrift that was beloved after his means ?

Who , without those means thou talkest of , didst thou ever know beloved ?

Myself .

I understand thee ; thou hadst some means to keep a dog .

What things in the world canst thou nearest compare to thy flatterers ?

Women nearest ; but men , men are the things themselves . What wouldst thou do with the world , Apemantus , if it lay in thy power ?

Give it the beasts , to be rid of the men .

Wouldst thou have thyself fall in the confusion of men , and remain a beast with the beasts ?

Ay , Timon .

A beastly ambition , which the gods grant thee to attain to . If thou wert the lion , the fox would beguile thee ; if thou wert the lamb , the fox would eat thee ; if thou wert the fox , the lion would suspect thee , when peradventure thou wert accused by the ass ; if thou wert the ass , thy dulness would torment thee , and still thou livedst but as a breakfast to the wolf ; if thou wert the wolf , thy greediness would afflict thee , and oft thou shouldst hazard thy life for thy dinner ; wert thou the unicorn , pride and wrath would confound thee and make thine own self the conquest of thy fury ; wert thou a bear , thou wouldst be killed by the horse ; wert thou a horse , thou wouldst be seized by the leopard ; wert thou a leopard , thou wert german to the lion , and the spots of thy kindred were jurors on thy life ; all thy safety were remotion , and thy defence absence . What beast couldst thou be , that were not subject to a beast ? and what a beast art thou already , that seest not thy loss in transformation !

If thou couldst please me with speaking to me , thou mightst have hit upon it here ; the commonwealth of Athens is become a forest of beasts .

How has the ass broke the wall , that thou art out of the city ?

Yonder comes a poet and a painter : the plague of company light upon thee , I will fear to catch it , and give way . When I know not what else to do , I'll see thee again .

When there is nothing living but thee , thou shalt be welcome . I had rather be a beggar's dog than Apemantus .

Thou art the cap of all the fools alive .

Would thou wert clean enough to spit upon !

A plague on thee , thou art too bad to curse !

All villains that do stand by thee are pure .

There is no leprosy but what thou speak'st .

If I name thee .
I'll beat thee , but I should infect my hands .

I would my tongue could rot them off !

Away , thou issue of a mangy dog !
Choler does kill me that thou art alive ;
I swound to see thee .

Would thou wouldst burst !

Away ,
Thou tedious rogue , I am sorry I shall lose 
A stone by thee .


Beast !

Slave !

Toad !

Rogue , rogue , rogue !
I am sick of this false world , and will love nought 
But even the mere necessities upon 't .
Then , Timon , presently prepare thy grave ;
Lie where the light foam of the sea may beat 
Thy grave-stone daily : make thine epitaph ,
That death in me at others' lives may laugh .

O thou sweet king-killer , and dear divorce 
'Twixt natural son and sire , thou bright defiler 
Of Hymen's purest bed , thou valiant Mars !
Thou ever young , fresh , lov'd , and delicate wooer ,
Whose blush doth thaw the consecrated snow 
That lies on Dian's lap , thou visible god ,
That solder'st close impossibilities ,
And mak'st them kiss , that speak'st with every tongue ,
To every purpose , O thou touch of hearts !
Think , thy slave man rebels , and by thy virtue 
Set them into confounding odds , that beasts 
May have the world in empire .

Would 'twere so :
But not till I am dead ; I'll say thou'st gold :
Thou wilt be throng'd to shortly .

Throng'd to ?

Ay .

Thy back , I prithee .

Live , and love thy misery !

Long live so , and so die !

I am quit .
More things like men , Eat , Timon , and abhor them .


Where should he have this gold ? It is some poor fragment , some slender ort of his remainder . The mere want of gold , and the falling-from of his friends , drove him into this melancholy .

It is noised he hath a mass of treasure .

Let us make the assay upon him : if he care not for 't , he will supply us easily ; if he covetously reserve it , how shall's get it ?

True ; for he bears it not about him , 'tis hid .

Is not this he ?

Where ?

'Tis his description .

He ; I know him .

Save thee , Timon .

Now , thieves ?

Soldiers , not thieves .

Both too ; and women's sons .

We are not thieves , but men that much do want .

Your greatest want is , you want much of meat .
Why should you want ? Behold , the earth hath roots ;
Within this mile break forth a hundred springs ;
The oaks bear mast , the briers scarlet hips ;
The bounteous housewife , nature , on each bush 
Lays her full mess before you . Want , why want ?

We cannot live on grass , on berries , water ,
As beasts , and birds , and fishes .

Nor on the beasts themselves , the birds , and fishes ;
You must eat men . Yet thanks I must you con 
That you are thieves profess'd , that you work not 
In holier shapes ; for there is boundless theft 
In limited professions . Rascal thieves ,
Here's gold . Go , suck the subtle blood o' the grape ,
Till the high fever seethe your blood to froth ,
And so 'scape hanging : trust not the physician ;
His antidotes are poison , and he slays 
More than you rob : take wealth and lives together ;
Do villany , do , since you protest to do't ,
Like workmen . I'll example you with thievery :
The sun's a thief , and with his great attraction 
Robs the vast sea ; the moon's an arrant thief ,
And her pale fire she snatches from the sun ;
The sea's a thief , whose liquid surge resolves 
The moon into salt tears ; the earth's a thief ,
That feeds and breeds by a composture stolen 
From general excrement , each thing's a thief ;
The laws , your curb and whip , in their rough power 
Have uncheck'd theft . Love not yourselves ; away !
Rob one another . There's more gold : cut throats ;
All that you meet are thieves . To Athens go ,
Break open shops ; nothing can you steal 
But thieves do lose it : steal no less for this 
I give you ; and gold confound you howsoe'er !
Amen .

He has almost charmed me from my profession , by persuading me to it .

'Tis in the malice of mankind that he thus advises us ; not to have us thrive in our mystery .

I'll believe him as an enemy , and give over my trade .

Let us first see peace in Athens ; there is no time so miserable but a man may be true .

O you gods !
Is yond despised and ruinous man my lord ?
Full of decay and failing ? O monument 
And wonder of good deeds evilly bestow'd !
What an alteration of honour 
Has desperate want made !
What viler thing upon the earth than friends 
Who can bring noblest minds to basest ends !
How rarely does it meet with this time's guise ,
When man was wish'd to love his enemies !
Grant I may ever love , and rather woo 
Those that would mischief me than those that do !
He hath caught me in his eye : I will present 
My honest grief unto him ; and , as my lord ,
Still serve him with my life . My dearest master !


Away , what art thou ?

Have you forgot me , sir ?

Why dost ask that ? I have forgot all men ;
Then , if thou grant'st thou'rt a man , I have forgot thee .

An honest poor servant of yours .

Then I know thee not :
I never had an honest man about me ; ay all 
I kept were knaves , to serve in meat to villains .

The gods are witness ,
Ne'er did poor steward wear a truer grief 
For his undone lord than mine eyes for you .

What , dost thou weep ? Come nearer . Then I love thee ,
Because thou art a woman , and disclaim'st 
Flinty mankind ; whose eyes do never give ,
But thorough lust and laughter . Pity's sleeping :
Strange times , that weep with laughing , not with weeping !

I beg of you to know me , good my lord ,
To accept my grief and whilst this poor wealth lasts 
To entertain me as your steward still .

Had I a steward 
So true , so just , and now so comfortable ?
It almost turns my dangerous nature mild .
Let me behold thy face . Surely , this man 
Was born of woman .
Forgive my general and exceptless rashness ,
You perpetual sober gods , I do proclaim 
One honest man , mistake me not , but one ;
No more , I pray , and he's a steward .
How fain would I have hated all mankind !
And thou redeem'st thyself : but all , save thee ,
I fell with curses .
Methinks thou art more honest now than wise ;
For , by oppressing and betraying me ,
Thou mightst have sooner got another service :
For many so arrive at second masters 
Upon their first lord's neck . But tell me true ,
For I must ever doubt , though ne'er so sure ,
Is not thy kindness subtle , covetous ,
If not a usuring kindness and as rich men deal gifts ,
Expecting in return twenty for one ?

No , my most worthy master ; in whose breast 
Doubt and suspect , alas , are plac'd too late .
You should have fear'd false times when you did feast ;
Suspect still comes when an estate is least .
That which I show , heaven knows , is merely love ,
Duty and zeal to your unmatched mind ,
Care of your food and living ; and , believe it ,
My most honour'd lord ,
For any benefit that points to me ,
Either in hope , or present , I'd exchange 
For this one wish , that you had power and wealth 
To requite me by making rich yourself .

Look thee , 'tis so . Thou singly honest man ,
Here , take : the gods out of my misery ,
Have sent thee treasure . Go , live rich and happy ;
But thus condition'd : thou shalt build from men ;
Hate all , curse all , show charity to none ,
But let the famish'd flesh slide from the bone ,
Ere thou relieve the beggar ; give to dogs 
What thou deny'st to men ; let prisons swallow 'em ,
Debts wither 'em to nothing ; be men like blasted woods ,
And may diseases lick up their false bloods !
And so , farewell and thrive .

O , let me stay 
And comfort you , my master .

If thou hatest 
Curses , stay not ; fly , whilst thou'rt bless'd and free :
Ne'er see thou man , and let me ne'er see thee .

As I took note of the place , it cannot be far where he abides .

What's to be thought of him ? Does the rumour hold for true that he is so full of gold ?

Certain : Alcibiades reports it ; Phrynia and Timandra had gold of him : he likewise enriched poor straggling soldiers with great quantity . 'Tis said he gave unto his steward a mighty sum .

Then this breaking of his has been but a try for his friends .

Nothing else ; you shall see him a palm in Athens again , and flourish with the highest . Therefore 'tis not amiss we tender our loves to him , in this supposed distress of his : it will show honestly in us , and is very likely to load our purposes with what they travel for , if it be a just and true report that goes of his having .

What have you now to present unto him ?

Nothing at this time but my visitation ; only , I will promise him an excellent piece .

I must serve him so too ; tell him of an intent that's coming towards him .

Good as the best . Promising is the very air o' the time ; it opens the eyes of expectation ; performance is ever the duller for his act ; and , but in the plainer and simpler kind of people , the deed of saying is quite out of use . To promise is most courtly and fashionable ; performance is a kind of will or testament which argues a great sickness in his judgment that makes it .


Excellent workman , Thou canst not paint a man so bad as is thyself .

I am thinking what I shall say I have provided for him : it must be a personating of himself ; a satire against the softness of prosperity , with a discovery of the infinite flatteries that follow youth and opulency .

Must thou needs stand for a villain in thine own work ? Wilt thou whip thine own faults in other men ? Do so , I have gold for thee .

Nay , let's seek him :
Then do we sin against our own estate ,
When we may profit meet , and come too late .

True ;
When the day serves , before black-corner'd night ,
Find what thou want'st by free and offer'd light .
Come .

I'll meet you at the turn . What a god's gold ,
That he is worshipp'd in a baser temple 
Than where swine feed !
'Tis thou that rigg'st the bark and plough'st the foam ,
Settlest admired reverence in a slave :
To thee be worship ; and thy saints for aye 
Be crown'd with plagues that thee alone obey .
Fit I meet them .


Hail , worthy Timon !

Our late noble master !

Have I once liv'd to see two honest men ?

Sir ,
Having often of your open bounty tasted ,
Hearing you were retir'd , your friends fall'n off ,
Whose thankless natures O abhorred spirits !
Not all the whips of heaven are large enough 
What , to you ,
Whose star-like nobleness gave life and influence 
To their whole being , I am rapt , and cannot cover 
The monstrous bulk of this ingratitude 
With any size of words .

Let it go naked , men may see 't the better :
You , that are honest , by being what you are ,
Make them best seen and known .

He and myself 
Have travell'd in the great shower of your gifts ,
And sweetly felt it .

Ay , you are honest men .

We are hither come to offer you our service .

Most honest men , Why , how shall I requite you ?
Can you eat roots and drink cold water ? no .

What we can do , we'll do , to do you service .

Ye're honest men . Ye've heard that I have gold ;
I am sure you have : speak truth ; ye're honest men .

So it is said , my noble lord ; but therefore 
Came not my friend nor I .

Good honest men , Thou draw'st a counterfeit 
Best in all Athens : thou'rt , indeed , the best ;
Thou counterfeit'st most lively .

So , so , my lord .

E'en so , sir , as I say . And , for thy fiction ,
Why , thy verse swells with stuff so fine and smooth 
That thou art even natural in thine art .
But for all this , my honest-natur'd friends ,
I must needs say you have a little fault :
Marry , 'tis not monstrous in you , neither wish I 
You take much pains to mend .

Beseech your honour 
To make it known to us .

You'll take it ill .

Most thankfully , my lord .

Will you indeed ?

Doubt it not , worthy lord .

There's never a one of you but trusts a knave ,
That mightily deceives you .

Do we , my lord ?

Ay , and you hear him cog , see him dissemble ,
Know his gross patchery , love him , feed him ,
Keep in your bosom ; yet remain assur'd 
That he's a made-up villain .

I know none such , my lord .

Nor I .

Look you , I love you well ; I'll give you gold ,
Rid me these villains from your companies :
Hang them or stab them , drown them in a draught ,
Confound them by some course , and come to me ,
I'll give you gold enough .

Name them , my lord ; let's know them .

You that way and you this , but two in company ;
Each man apart , all single and alone ,
Yet an arch villain keeps him company .
If , where thou art two villains shall not be ,
Come not near him .

If thou would not reside 
But where one villain is , then him abandon .
Hence , pack , there's gold ; ye came for gold , ye slaves :
You have done work for me , there's payment : hence !
You are an alchemist , make gold of that .
Out , rascal dogs !

It is in vain that you would speak with Timon ;
For he is set so only to himself 
That nothing but himself , which looks like man ,
Is friendly with him .

Bring us to his cave :
It is our part and promise to the Athenians 
To speak with Timon .

At all times alike 
Men are not still the same : 'twas time and griefs 
That fram'd him thus : time , with his fairer hand ,
Offering the fortunes of his former days ,
The former man may make him . Bring us to him ,
And chance it as it may .

Here is his cave .
Peace and content be here , Lord Timon , Timon !
Look out , and speak to friends . The Athenians ,
By two of their most reverend senate , greet thee :
Speak to them , noble Timon .


Thousun , that comfort'st , burn , Speak , and be hang'd :
For each true word , a blister , and each false 
Be as a cauterizing to the root o'the tongue ,
Consuming it with speaking !

Worthy Timon ,

Of none but such as you , and you of Timon .

The senators of Athens greet thee , Timon .

I thank them ; and would send them back the plague ,
Could I but catch it for them .

O , forget 
What we are sorry for ourselves in thee .
The senators with one consent of love 
Entreat thee back to Athens ; who have thought 
On special dignities , which vacant lie 
For thy best use and wearing .

They confess 
Toward thee forgetfulness to general , gross ;
Which now the public body , which doth seldom 
Play the recanter , feeling in itself 
A lack of Timon's aid , hath sense withal 
Of its own fail , restraining aid to Timon ;
And send forth us , to make their sorrow'd render ,
Together with a recompense more fruitful 
Than their offence can weigh down by the dram ;
Ay , even such heaps and sums of love and wealth 
As shall to thee block out what wrongs were theirs ,
And write in thee the figures of their love ,
Ever to read them thine .

You witch me in it ;
Surprise me to the very brink of tears :
Lend me a fool's heart and a woman's eyes ,
And I'll beweep these comforts , worthy senators .

Therefore so please thee to return with us ,
And of our Athens thine and ours to take 
The captainship , thou shalt be met with thanks ,
Allow'd with absolute power , and thy good name 
Live with authority : so soon we shall drive back 
Of Alcibiades the approaches wild ;
Who , like a boar too savage , doth root up 
His country's peace .

And shakes his threat'ning sword 
Against the walls of Athens .

Therefore , Timon ,

Well , sir , I will ; therefore , I will , sir ; thus :
If Alcibiades kill my countrymen ,
Let Alcibiades know this of Timon ,
That Timon cares not . But if he sack fair Athens ,
And take our goodly aged men by the beards ,
Giving our holy virgins to the stain 
Of contumelious , beastly , mad-brain'd war ;
Then let him know , and tell him Timon speaks it ,
In pity of our aged and our youth 
I cannot choose but tell him , that I care not ,
And let him take't at worst ; for their knives care not 
While you have throats to answer : for myself ,
There's not a whittle in the unruly camp 
But I do prize it at my love before 
The reverend'st throat in Athens . So I leave you 
To the protection of the prosperous gods ,
As thieves to keepers .

Stay not ; all's in vain .

Why , I was writing of my epitaph ;
It will be seen to-morrow . My long sickness 
Of health and living now begins to mend ,
And nothing brings me all things . Go ; live still :
Be Alcibiades your plague , you his ,
And last so long enough !

We speak in vain .

But yet I love my country , and am not 
One that rejoices in the common wrack ,
As common bruit doth put it .

That's well spoke .

Commend me to my loving countrymen ,

These words become your lips as they pass through them .

And enter in our ears like great triumphers 
In their applauding gates .

Commend me to them ;
And tell them , that , to ease them of their griefs ,
Their fears of hostile strokes , their aches , losses ,
Their pangs of love , with other incident throes 
That nature's fragile vessel doth sustain 
In life's uncertain voyage , I will some kindness do them :
I'll teach them to prevent wild Alcibiades' wrath .

I like this well ; he will return again .

I have a tree which grows here in my close ,
That mine own use invites me to cut down ,
And shortly must I fell it ; tell my friends ,
Tell Athens , in the sequence of degree ,
From high to low throughout , that whoso please 
To stop affliction , let him take his haste ,
Come hither , ere my tree hath felt the axe ,
And hang himself . I pray you , do my greeting .

Trouble him no further ; thus you still shall find him .

Come not to me again ; but say to Athans ,
Timon hath made his everlasting mansion 
Upon the beached verge of the salt flood ;
Who once a day with his embossed froth 
The turbulent surge shall cover : thither come ,
And let my grave-stone be your oracle .
Lips , let sour words go by and language end :
What is amiss plague and infection mend !
Graves only be men's works and death their gain !
Sun , hide thy beams , Timon hath done his reign .


His discontents are unremovably Coupled to nature .

Our hope in him is dead : let us return ,
And strain what other means is left unto us 
In our dear peril .

It requires swift foot .


Thou hast painfully discover'd : are his files 
As full as thy report ?

I have spoke the least ;
Besides , his expedition promises 
Present approach .

We stand much hazard if they bring not Timon .

I met a courier , one mine ancient friend ,
Whom , though in general part we were oppos'd ,
Yet our old love made a particular force ,
And made us speak like friends : this man was riding 
From Alcibiades to Timon's cave ,
With letters of entreaty , which imported 
His fellowship i' the cause against your city ,
In part for his sake mov'd .

Here come our brothers .


No talk of Timon , nothing of him expect .
The enemies' drum is heard , and fearful scouring 
Doth choke the air with dust . In , and prepare :
Ours is the fall , I fear ; our foes the snare .


By all description this should be the place .
Who's here ? speak , ho , No answer , What is this ?
Timon is dead , who hath outstretch'd his span :
Some beast rear'd this ; here does not live a man .
Dead , sure ; and this his grave . What's on this tomb 
I cannot read ; the character I'll take with wax :
Our captain hath in every figure skill ;
An ag'd interpreter , though young in days .
Before proud Athens he's set down by this ,
Whose fall the mark of his ambition is .


Sound to this coward and lascivious town 
Our terrible approach .

Till now you have gone on , and fill'd the time 
With all licentious measure , making your wills 
The scope of justice ; till now myself and such 
As slept within the shadow of your power 
Have wander'd with our travers'd arms , and breath'd 
Our sufferance vainly . Now the time is flush ,
When crouching marrow , in the bearer strong ,
Cries of itself , 'No more :' now breathless wrong 
Shall sit and pant in your great chairs of ease ,
And pursy insolence shall break his wind 

With fear and horrid flight .

Noble and young ,
When thy first griefs were but a mere conceit ,
Ere thou hadst power or we had cause of fear ,
We sent to thee , to give thy rages balm ,
To wipe out our ingratitude with loves 
Above their quantity .

So did we woo 
Transformed Timon to our city's love 
By humble message and by promis'd means :
We were not all unkind , nor all deserve 
The common stroke of war .

These walls of ours 
Were not erected by their hands from whom 
You have receiv'd your grief ; nor are they such 
That these great towers , trophies , and schools should fall 
For private faults in them .

Nor are they living 
Who were the motives that you first went out ;
Shame that they wanted cunning in excess 
Hath broke their hearts . March , noble lord ,
Into our city with thy banners spread :
By decimation , and a tithed death ,
If thy revenges hunger for that food 
Which nature loathes ,take thou the destin'd tenth ,
And by the hazard of the spotted die 
Let die the spotted .

All have not offended ;
For those that were , it is not square to take 
On those that are , revenges : crimes , like lands ,
Are not inherited . Then , dear countryman ,
Bring in thy ranks , but leave without thy rage :
Spare thyAthenian cradle , and those kin 
Which in the bluster of thy wrath must fall 
With those that have offended : like a shepherd ,
Approach the fold and cull th' infected forth ,
But kill not all together .

What thou wilt ,
Thou rather shalt enforce it with thy smile 
Thank hew to't with thy sword .

Set but thy foot 
Against our rampir'd gates , and they shall ope ,
So thou wilt send thy gentle heart before ,
To say thou'lt enter friendly .

Throw thy glove ,
Or any token of thine honour else ,
That thou wilt use the wars as thy redress 
And not as our confusion , all thy powers 
Shall make their harbour in our town , till we 
Have seal'd thy full desire .

Then there's my glove ;
Descend , and open your uncharged ports :
Those enemies of Timon's and mine own 
Whom you yourselves shall set out for reproof ,
Fall , and no more ; and , to atone your fears 
With my more noble meaning , not a man 
Shall pass his quarter , or offend the stream 
Of regular justice in your city's bounds ,
But shall be render'd to your public laws 
At heaviest answer .

'Tis most nobly spoken .

Descend , and keep your words .

My noble general , Timon is dead ;
Entomb'd upon the very hem o' the sea :
And on his grave-stone this insculpture , which 
With wax I brought away , whose soft impression 
Interprets for my poor ignorance .

Here lies a wretched corse , of wretched soul bereft :
Seek not my name : a plague consume you wicked caitiffs left !
Here lie I , Timon ; who , alive , all living men did hate :
Pass by , and curse thy fill ; but pass and stay not here thy gait .
These well express in thee thy latter spirits :
Though thou abhorr'dst in us our human griefs ,
Scorn'dst our brain's flow and those our droplets which 
From niggard nature fall , yet rich conceit 
Taught thee to make vast Neptune weep for aye 
On thy low grave , on faults forgiven . Dead 
Is noble Timon ; of whose memory 
Hereafter more . Bring me into your city ,
And I will use the olive with my sword ;
Make war breed peace ; make peace stint war ; make each 
Prescribe to other as each other's leech .
Let our drums strike .

TITUS ANDRONICUS

 
Noble patricians , patrons of my right ,
Defend the justice of my cause with arms ;
And , countrymen , my loving followers ,
Plead my successive title with your swords :
I am his first-born son that was the last 
That wore the imperial diadem of Rome ;
Then let my father's honours live in me ,
Nor wrong mine age with this indignity .

Romans , friends , followers , favourers of my right ,
If ever Bassianus , C sar's son ,
Were gracious in the eyes of royal Rome ,
Keep then this passage to the Capitol ,
And suffer not dishonour to approach 
The imperial seat , to virtue consecrate ,
To justice , continence , and nobility ;
But let desert in pure election shine ,
And , Romans , fight for freedom in your choice .


Princes , that strive by factions and by friends 
Ambitiously for rule and empery ,
Know that the people of Rome , for whom we stand 
A special party , have , by common voice ,
In election for the Roman empery ,
Chosen Andronicus , surnamed Pius ,
For many good and great deserts to Rome :
A nobler man , a braver warrior ,
Lives not this day within the city walls :
He by the senate is accited home 
From weary wars against the barbarous Goths ;
That , with his sons , a terror to our foes ,
Hath yok'd a nation , strong , train'd up in arms .
Ten years are spent since first he undertook 
This cause of Rome , and chastised with arms 
Our enemies' pride : five times he hath return'd 
Bleeding to Rome , bearing his valiant sons 
In coffins from the field ;
And now at last , laden with honour's spoils ,
Returns the good Andronicus to Rome ,
Renowned Titus , flourishing in arms .
Let us entreat , by honour of his name ,
Whom worthily you would have now succeed ,
And in the Capitol and senate's right ,
Whom you pretend to honour and adore ,
That you withdraw you and abate your strength ;
Dismiss your followers , and , as suitors should ,
Plead your deserts in peace and humbleness .

How fair the tribune speaks to calm my thoughts !

Marcus Andronicus , so I do affy 
In thy uprightness and integrity ,
And so I love and honour thee and thine ,
Thy noble brother Titus and his sons ,
And her to whom my thoughts are humbled all ,
Gracious Lavinia , Rome's rich ornament ,
That I will here dismiss my loving friends ,
And to my fortunes and the people's favour 
Commit my cause in balance to be weigh'd .


Friends , that have been thus forward in my right ,
I thank you all and here dismiss you all ;
And to the love and favour of my country 
Commit myself , my person , and the cause .

Rome , be as just and gracious unto me 
As I am confident and kind to thee .
Open the gates , and let me in .

Tribunes , and me , a poor competitor .

Romans , make way , the good Andronicus ,
Patron of virtue , Rome's best champion ,
Successful in the battles that he fights ,
With honour and with fortune is return'd 
From where he circumscribed with his sword ,
And brought to yoke , the enemies of Rome .

Hail , Rome , victorious in thy mourning weeds !
Lo , as the bark , that hath discharg'd her fraught ,
Returns with precious lading to the bay 
From whence at first she weigh'd her anchorage ,
Cometh Andronicus , bound with laurel boughs ,
To re-salute his country with his tears ,
Tears of true joy for his return to Rome .
Thou great defender of this Capitol ,
Stand gracious to the rites that we intend !
Romans , of five-and-twenty valiant sons ,
Half of the number that King Priam had ,
Behold the poor remains , alive , and dead !
These that survive let Rome reward with love ;
These that I bring unto their latest home .
With burial among their ancestors :
Here Goths have given me leave to sheathe my sword .
Titus , unkind and careless of thine own ,
Why suffer'st thou thy sons , unburied yet 
To hover on the dreadful shore of Styx ?
Make way to lay them by their brethren .

There greet in silence , as the dead are wont ,
And sleep in peace , slain in your country's wars !
O sacred receptacle of my joys ,
Sweet cell of virtue and nobility ,
How many sons of mine hast thou in store ,
That thou wilt never render to me more !

Give us the proudest prisoner of the Goths ,
That we may hew his limbs , and on a pile 
Ad manes fratrum sacrifice his flesh ,
Before this earthy prison of their bones ;
That so the shadows be not unappeas'd ,
Nor we disturb'd with prodigies on earth .

I give him you , the noblest that survives 
The eldest son of this distressed queen .

Stay , Roman brethren , Gracious conqueror ,
Victorious Titus , rue the tears I shed ,
A mother's tears in passion for her son :
And if thy sons were ever dear to thee ,
O , think my son to be as dear to me .
Sufficeth not that we are brought to Rome ,
To beautify thy triumphs and return ,
Captive to thee and to thy Roman yoke ;
But must my sons be slaughter'd in the streets 
For valiant doings in their country's cause ?
O , if to fight for king and commonweal 
Were piety in thine , it is in these .
Andronicus , stain not thy tomb with blood :
Wilt thou draw near the nature of the gods ?
Draw near them then in being merciful ;
Sweet mercy is nobility's true badge :
Thrice-noble Titus , spare my first-born son .

Patient yourself , madam , and pardon me .
These are their brethren , whom your Goths beheld 
Alive and dead , and for their brethren slain 
Religiously they ask a sacrifice :
To this your son is mark'd , and die he must ,
To appease their groaning shadows that are gone .

Away with him , and make a fire straight ;
And with our swords , upon a pile of wood ,
Let's hew his limbs till they be clean consum'd .


O cruel , irreligious piety !

Was ever Scythia half so barbarous ?

Oppose not Scythia to ambitious Rome .
Alarbus goes to rest , and we survive 
To tremble under Titus' threatening look .
Then , madam , stand resolv'd ; but hope withal 
The self-same gods , that arm'd the Queen of Troy 
With opportunity of sharp revenge 
Upon the Thracian tyrant in his tent ,
May favour Tamora , the Queen of Goths 
When Goths were Goths , and Tamora was queen 
To quit the bloody wrongs upon her foes .


See , lord and father , how we have perform'd 
Our Roman rites . Alarbus' limbs are lopp'd ,
And entrails feed the sacrificing fire ,
Whose smoke , like incense , doth perfume the sky .
Remaineth nought but to inter our brethren ,
And with loud 'larums welcome them to Rome .

Let it be so ; and let Andronicus 
Make this his latest farewell to their souls .

In peace and honour rest you here , my sons ;
Rome's readiest champions , repose you here in rest ,
Secure from worldly chances and mishaps !
Here lurks no treason , here no envy swells ,
Here grow no damned drugs , here are no storms ,
No noise , but silence and eternal sleep :
In peace and honour rest you here , my sons !


In peace and honour live Lord Titus long ;
My noble lord and father , live in fame !
Lo , at this tomb my tributary tears 
I render for my brethren's obsequies ;
And at thy feet I kneel , with tears of joy 
Shed on the earth for thy return to Rome .
O , bless me here with thy victorious hand ,
Whose fortunes Rome's best citizens applaud .

Kind Rome , that hast thus lovingly reserv'd 
The cordial of mine age to glad my heart !
Lavinia , live ; outlive thy father's days ,
And fame's eternal date , for virtue's praise !


Long live Lord Titus , my beloved brother ,
Gracious triumpher in the eyes of Rome !

Thanks , gentle Tribune , noble brother Marcus .

And welcome , nephews , from successful wars ,
You that survive , and you that sleep in fame !
Fair lords , your fortunes are alike in all ,
That in your country's service drew your swords ;
But safer triumph is this funeral pomp ,
That hath aspir'd to Solon's happiness ,
And triumphs over chance in honour's bed .
Titus Andronicus , the people of Rome ,
Whose friend in justice thou hast ever been ,
Send thee by me , their tribune and their trust ,
This palliament of white and spotless hue ;
And name thee in election for the empire ,
With these our late-deceased emperor's sons :
Be candidatus then , and put it on ,
And help to set a head on headless Rome .

A better head her glorious body fits 
Than his that shakes for age and feebleness .
What should I don this robe , and trouble you ?
Be chosen with proclamations to-day ,
To-morrow yield up rule , resign my life ,
And set abroad new business for you all ?
Rome , I have been thy soldier forty years ,
And led my country's strength successfully ,
And buried one-and-twenty valiant sons ,
Knighted in field , slain manfully in arms ,
In right and service of their noble country .
Give me a staff of honour for mine age ,
But not a sceptre to control the world :
Upright he held it , lords , that held it last .

Titus , thou shalt obtain and ask the empery .

Proud and ambitious tribune , canst thou tell ?

Patience , Prince Saturninus .

Romans , do me right :
Patricians , draw your swords , and sheathe them not 
Till Saturninus be Rome's emperor .
Andronicus , would thou wert shipp'd to hell ,
Rather than rob me of the people's hearts !

Proud Saturnine , interrupter of the good 
That noble-minded Titus means to thee !

Content thee , prince ; I will restore to thee 
The people's hearts , and wean them from themselves .

Andronicus , I do not flatter thee ,
But honour thee , and will do till I die :
My faction if thou strengthen with thy friends ,
I will most thankful be ; and thanks to men 
Of noble minds is honourable meed .

People of Rome , and people's tribunes here ,
I ask your voices and your suffrages :
Will you bestow them friendly on Andronicus ?

To gratify the good Andronicus ,
And gratulate his safe return to Rome ,
The people will accept whom he admits .

Tribunes , I thank you ; and this suit I make ,
That you create your emperor's eldest son ,
Lord Saturnine ; whose virtues will , I hope ,
Reflect on Rome as Titan's rays on earth ,
And ripen justice in this commonweal :
Then , if you will elect by my advice ,
Crown him , and say , 'Long live our emperor !' 

With voices and applause of every sort ,
Patricians and plebeians , we create 
Lord Saturninus Rome's great emperor ,
And say , 'Long live our Emperor Saturnine !' 


Titus Andronicus , for thy favours done 
To us in our election this day ,
I give thee thanks in part of thy deserts ,
And will with deeds requite thy gentleness :
And , for an onset , Titus , to advance 
Thy name and honourable family ,
Lavinia will I make my empress ,
Rome's royal mistress , mistress of my heart ,
And in the sacred Pantheon her espouse .
Tell me , Andronicus , doth this motion please thee ?

It doth , my worthy lord ; and in this match 
I hold me highly honour'd of your Grace :
And here in sight of Rome to Saturnine ,
King and commander of our commonweal ,
The wide world's emperor , do I consecrate 
My sword , my chariot , and my prisoners ;
Presents well worthy Rome's imperious lord :
Receive them then , the tribute that I owe ,
Mine honour's ensigns humbled at thy feet .

Thanks , noble Titus , father of my life !
How proud I am of thee and of thy gifts 
Rome shall record , and , when I do forget 
The least of these unspeakable deserts ,
Romans , forget your fealty to me .

Now , madam , are you prisoner to an emperor ;
To him that , for your honour and your state ,
Will use you nobly and your followers .

A goodly lady , trust me ; of the hue 
That I would choose , were I to choose anew .
Clear up , fair queen , that cloudy countenance :
Though chance of war hath wrought this change of cheer ,
Thou com'st not to be made a scorn in Rome :
Princely shall be thy usage every way .
Rest on my word , and let not discontent 
Daunt all your hopes : madam , he comforts you 
Can make you greater than the Queen of Goths .
Lavinia , you are not displeas'd with this ?

Not I , my lord ; sith true nobility 
Warrants these words in princely courtesy .

Thanks , sweet Lavinia . Romans , let us go ;
Ransomless here we set our prisoners free :
Proclaim our honours , lords , with trump and drum .


Lord Titus , by your leave , this maid is mine .


How , sir , Are you in earnest then , my lord ?

Ay , noble Titus ; and resolv'd withal 
To do myself this reason and this right .

Suum cuique is our Roman justice :
This prince in justice seizeth but his own .

And that he will , and shall , if Lucius live .

Traitors , avaunt , Where is the emperor's guard ?
Treason , my lord , Lavinia is surpris'd .

Surpris'd , By whom ?

By him that justly may 
Bear his betroth'd from all the world away .


Brothers , help to convey her hence away ,
And with my sword I'll keep this door safe .


Follow , my lord , and I'll soon bring her back .

My lord , you pass not here .

What , villain boy ;
Barr'st me my way in Rome ?


Help , Lucius , help !

My lord , you are unjust ; and , more than so ,
In wrongful quarrel you have slain your son .

Nor thou , nor he , are any sons of mine ;
My sons would never so dishonour me .
Traitor , restore Lavinia to the emperor .

Dead , if you will ; but not to be his wife 
That is another's lawful promis'd love .


No , Titus , no ; the emperor needs her not ,
Nor her , nor thee , nor any of thy stock :
I'll trust , by leisure , him that mocks me once ;
Thee never , nor thy traitorous haughty sons ,
Confederates all thus to dishonour me .
Was none in Rome to make a stale 
But Saturnine ? Full well , Andronicus ,
Agreed these deeds with that proud brag of thine ,
That saidst I begg'd the empire at thy hands .

O monstrous , what reproachful words are these !

But go thy ways ; go , give that changing piece 
To him that flourish'd for her with his sword .
A valiant son-in-law thou shalt enjoy ;
One fit to bandy with thy lawless sons ,
To ruffle in the commonwealth of Rome .

These words are razors to my wounded heart .

And therefore , lovely Tamora , Queen of Goths ,
That like the stately Ph be 'mongst her nymphs ,
Dost overshine the gallant'st dames of Rome ,
If thou be pleas'd with this my sudden choice ,
Behold , I choose thee , Tamora , for my bride ,
And will create thee Empress of Rome .
Speak , Queen of Goths , dost thou applaud my choice ?
And here I swear by all the Roman gods ,
Sith priest and holy water are so near ,
And tapers burn so bright , and every thing 
In readiness for Hymen us stand ,
I will not re-salute the streets of Rome ,
Or climb my palace , till from forth this place 
I lead espous'd my bride along with me .

And here , in sight of heaven , to Rome I swear ,
If Saturnine advance the Queen of Goths ,
She will a handmaid be to his desires ,
A loving nurse , a mother to his youth .

Ascend , fair queen , Pantheon . Lords , accompany 
Your noble emperor , and his lovely bride ,
Sent by the heavens for Prince Saturnine ,
Whose wisdom hath her fortune conquered :
There shall we consummate our spousal rights .


I am not bid to wait upon this bride .
Titus , when wert thou wont to walk alone ,
Dishonour'd thus , and challenged of wrongs ?


O , Titus , see , O , see what thou hast done ;
In a bad quarrel slain a virtuous son .

No , foolish tribune , no ; no son of mine ,
Nor thou , nor these , confederates in the deed 
That hath dishonour'd all our family :
Unworthy brother , and unworthy sons !

But let us give him burial , as becomes ;
Give Mutius burial with our brethren .

Traitors , away , he rests not in this tomb .
This monument five hundred years hath stood ,
Which I have sumptuously re-edified :
Here none but soldiers and Rome's servitors 
Repose in fame ; none basely slain in brawls .
Bury him where you can ; he comes not here .

My lord , this is impiety in you .
My nephew Mutius' deeds do plead for him ;
He must be buried with his brethren .

And shall , or him we will accompany .

And shall , or him we will accompany .

And shall , What villain was it spake that word ?

He that would vouch it in any place but here .

What , would you bury him in my despite ?

No , noble Titus ; but entreat of thee 
To pardon Mutius , and to bury him .

Marcus , even thou hast struck upon my crest ,
And , with these boys , mine honour thou hast wounded :
My foes I do repute you every one ;
So , trouble me no more , but get you gone .

He is not with himself ; let us withdraw .

Not I , till Mutius' bones be buried .


Brother , for in that name doth nature plead ,

Father , and in that name doth nature speak ,

Speak thou no more , if all the rest will speed .

Renowned Titus , more than half my soul ,

Dear father , soul and substance of us all ,

Suffer thy brother Marcus to inter 
His noble nephew here in virtue's nest ,
That died in honour and Lavinia's cause .
Thou art a Roman ; be not barbarous :
The Greeks upon advice did bury Ajax 
That slew himself ; and wise Laertes' son 
Did graciously plead for his funerals .
Let not young Mutius then , that was thy joy ,
Be barr'd his entrance here .

Rise , Marcus , rise .
The dismall'st day is this that e'er I saw ,
To be dishonour'd by my sons in Rome !
Well , bury him , and bury me the next .


There lie thy bones , sweet Mutius , with thy friends ,
Till we with trophies do adorn thy tomb .

No man shed tears for noble Mutius ;
He lives in fame that died in virtue's cause .

My lord ,to step out of these dreary dumps ,
How comes it that the subtle Queen of Goths 
Is of a sudden thus advanc'd in Rome ?

I know not , Marcus ; but I know it is ,
Whether by device or no , the heavens can tell .
Is she not , then , beholding to the man 
That brought her for this high good turn so far ?

Yes , and will nobly him remunerate .

So , Bassianus , you have play'd your prize :
God give you joy , sir , of your gallant bride .

And you of yours , my lord , I say no more ,
Nor wish no less ; and so I take my leave .

Traitor , if Rome have law or we have power ,
Thou and thy faction shall repent this rape .

Rape call you it , my lord , to seize my own ,
My true-betrothed love and now my wife ?
But let the laws of Rome determine all ;
Meanwhile , I am possess'd of that is mine .

'Tis good , sir : you are very short with us ;
But , if we live , we'll be as sharp with you .

My lord , what I have done , as best I may ,
Answer I must and shall do with my life .
Only thus much I give your Grace to know :
By all the duties that I owe to Rome ,
This noble gentleman , Lord Titus here ,
Is in opinion and in honour wrong'd ;
That , in the rescue of Lavinia ,
With his own hand did slay his youngest son ,
In zeal to you and highly mov'd to wrath 
To be controll'd in that he frankly gave :
Receive him then to favour , Saturnine ,
That hath express'd himself in all his deeds 
A father and a friend to thee and Rome .

Prince Bassianus , leave to plead my deeds :
'Tis thou and those that have dishonour'd me .
Rome and the righteous heavens be my judge ,
How I have lov'd and honour'd Saturnine !

My worthy lord , if ever Tamora 
Were gracious in those princely eyes of thine ,
Then hear me speak indifferently for all ;
And at my suit , sweet , pardon what is past .

What , madam , be dishonour'd openly ,
And basely put it up without revenge ?

Not so , my lord ; the gods of Rome forfend 
I should be author to dishonour you !
But on mine honour dare I undertake 
For good Lord Titus' innocence in all ,
Whose fury not dissembled speaks his griefs .
Then , at my suit , look graciously on him ;
Lose not so noble a friend on vain suppose ,
Nor with sour looks afflict his gentle heart .


My lord , be rul'd by me , be won at last ;
Dissemble all your griefs and discontents :
You are but newly planted in your throne ;
Lest then , the people , and patricians too ,
Upon a just survey , take Titus' part ,
And so supplant you for ingratitude ,
Which Rome reputes to be a heinous sin ,
Yield at entreats , and then let me alone .
I'll find a day to massacre them all ,
And raze their faction and their family ,
The cruel father , and his traitorous sons ,
To whom I sued for my dear son's life ;
And make them know what 'tis to let a queen 
Kneel in the streets and beg for grace in vain .


Come , come , sweet emperor ; come , Andronicus ;
Take up this good old man , and cheer the heart 
That dies in tempest of thy angry frown :

Rise , Titus , rise ; my empress hath prevail'd .

I thank your majesty , and her , my lord .
These words , these looks , infuse new life in me .

Titus , I am incorporate in Rome ,
A Roman now adopted happily ,
And must advise the emperor for his good .
This day all quarrels die , Andronicus ;
And let it be mine honour , good my lord ,
That I have reconcil'd your friends and you .
For you , Prince Bassianus , I have pass'd 
My word and promise to the emperor ,
That you will be more mild and tractable .
And fear not , lords , and you , Lavinia ,
By my advice , all humbled on your knees ,
You shall ask pardon of his majesty .

We do ; and vow to heaven and to his highness ,
That what we did was mildly , as we might ,
Tendering our sister's honour and our own .

That on mine honour here I do protest .

Away , and talk not ; trouble us no more .

Nay , nay , sweet emperor , we must all be friends :
The tribune and his nephews kneel for grace ;
I will not be denied : sweet heart , look back .

Marcus , for thy sake , and thy brother's here ,
And at my lovely Tamora's entreats ,
I do remit these young men's heinous faults :
Stand up .
Lavinia , though you left me like a churl ,
I found a friend , and sure as death I swore 
I would not part a bachelor from the priest .
Come ; if the emperor's court can feast two brides ,
You are my guest , Lavinia , and your friends .
This day shall be a love-day , Tamora .

To-morrow , an it please your majesty 
To hunt the panther and the hart with me ,
With horn and hound we'll give your Grace bon jour .

Be it so , Titus , and gramercy too .


Now climbeth Tamora Olympus' top ,
Safe out of Fortune's shot ; and sits aloft ,
Secure of thunder's crack or lightning flash ,
Advanc'd above pale envy's threat'ning reach .
As when the golden sun salutes the morn ,
And , having gilt the ocean with his beams ,
Gallops the zodiac in his glistering coach ,
And overlooks the highest-peering hills ;
So Tamora .
Upon her wit doth earthly honour wait 
And virtue stoops and trembles at her frown .
Then , Aaron , arm thy heart , and fit thy thoughts 
To mount aloft with thy imperial mistress ,
And mount her pitch , whom thou in triumph long 
Hast prisoner held , fetter'd in amorous chains ,
And faster bound to Aaron's charming eyes 
Than is Prometheus tied to Caucasus .
Away with slavish weeds and servile thoughts !
I will be bright , and shine in pearl and gold ,
To wait upon this new-made empress .
To wait , said I ? to wanton with this queen ,
This goddess , this Semiramis , this nymph ,
This siren , that will charm Rome's Saturnine ,
And see his shipwrack and his commonweal's .
Holla , what storm is this ?


Chiron , thy years want wit , thy wit wants edge 
And manners , to intrude where I am grac'd ,
And may , for aught thou know'st , affected be .

Demetrius , thou dost over-ween in all 
And so in this , to bear me down with braves .
'Tis not the difference of a year or two 
Makes me less gracious or thee more fortunate :
I am as able and as fit as thou 
To serve , and to deserve my mistress' grace ;
And that my sword upon thee shall approve ,
And plead my passions for Lavinia's love .

Clubs , clubs , these lovers will not keep the peace .

Why , boy , although our mother , unadvis'd ,
Gave you a dancing-rapier by your side ,
Are you so desperate grown , to threat your friends ?
Go to ; have your lath glu'd within your sheath 
Till you know better how to handle it .

Meanwhile , sir , with the little skill I have ,
Full well shalt thou perceive how much I dare .

Ay , boy , grow ye so brave ?


Why , how now , lords !
So near the emperor's palace dare you draw ,
And maintain such a quarrel openly ?
Full well I wot the ground of all this grudge :
I would not for a million of gold 
The cause were known to them it most concerns ;
Nor would your noble mother for much more 
Be so dishonour'd in the court of Rome .
For shame , put up .

Not I , till I have sheath'd 
My rapier in his bosom , and withal 
Thrust those reproachful speeches down his throat 
That he hath breath'd in my dishonour here .

For that I am prepar'd and full resolv'd ,
Foul-spoken coward , that thunder'st with thy tongue ,
And with thy weapon nothing dar'st perform !

Away , I say !
Now , by the gods that war-like Goths adore ,
This petty brabble will undo us all .
Why , lords , and think you not how dangerous 
It is to jet upon a prince's right ?
What , is Lavinia then become so loose ,
Or Bassianus so degenerate ,
That for her love such quarrels may be broach'd 
Without controlment , justice , or revenge ?
Young lords , beware , an should the empress know 
This discord's ground , the music would not please .

I care not , I , knew she and all the world :
I love Lavinia more than all the world .

Youngling , learn thou to make some meaner choice :
Lavinia is thine elder brother's hope .

Why , are ye mad ? or know ye not in Rome 
How furious and impatient they be ,
And cannot brook competitors in love ?
I tell you , lords , you do but plot your deaths 
By this device .

Aaron , a thousand deaths 
Would I propose , to achieve her whom I love .

To achieve her , how ?

Why mak'st thou it so strange ?
She is a woman , therefore may be woo'd ;
She is a woman , therefore may be won ;
She is Lavinia , therefore must be lov'd .
What , man , more water glideth by the mill 
Than wots the miller of ; and easy it is 
Of a cut loaf to steal a shive , we know :
Though Bassianus be the emperor's brother ,
Better than he have worn Vulcan's badge .

Ay , and as good as Saturninus may .

Then why should he despair that knows to court it 
With words , fair looks , and liberality ?
What , hast thou not full often struck a doe ,
And borne her cleanly by the keeper's nose ?

Why , then , it seems , some certain snatch or so 
Would serve your turns .

Ay , so the turn were serv'd .

Aaron , thou hast hit it .

Would you had hit it too !
Then should not we be tir'd with this ado .
Why , hark ye , hark ye , and are you such fools 
To square for this ? Would it offend you then 
That both should speed ?

Faith , not me .

Nor me , so I were one .

For shame , be friends , and join for that you jar :
'Tis policy and stratagem must do 
That you affect ; and so must you resolve ,
That what you cannot as you would achieve ,
You must perforce accomplish as you may .
Take this of me : Lucrece was not more chaste 
Than this Lavinia , Bassianus' love .
A speedier course than lingering languishment 
Must we pursue , and I have found the path .
My lords , a solemn hunting is in hand ;
There will the lovely Roman ladies troop :
The forest walks are wide and spacious ,
And many unfrequented plots there are 
Fitted by kind for rape and villany :
Single you thither then this dainty doe ,
And strike her home by force , if not by words :
This way , or not at all , stand you in hope .
Come , come , our empress , with her sacred wit 
To villany and vengeance consecrate ,
Will we acquaint with all that we intend ;
And she shall file our engines with advice ,
That will not suffer you to square yourselves ,
But to your wishes' height advance you both .
The emperor's court is like the house of Fame ,
The palace full of tongues , of eyes , and ears :
The woods are ruthless , dreadful , deaf , and dull ;
There speak , and strike , brave boys , and take your turns ;
There serve your lusts , shadow'd from heaven's eye ,
And revel in Lavinia's treasury .

Thy counsel , lad , smells of no cowardice .

Sit fas aut nefas , till I find the stream 
To cool this heat , a charm to calm these fits ,
Per Styga , per manes vehor .

The hunt is up , the morn is bright and grey ,
The fields are fragrant and the woods are green .
Uncouple here and let us make a bay ,
And wake the emperor and his lovely bride ,
And rouse the prince and ring a hunter's peal ,
That all the court may echo with the noise .
Sons , let it be your charge , as it is ours ,
To attend the emperor's person carefully :
I have been troubled in my sleep this night ,
But dawning day new comfort hath inspir'd .

Many good morrows to your majesty ;
Madam , to you as many and as good ;

I promised your Grace a hunter's peal .

And you have rung it lustily , my lord ;
Somewhat too early for new-married ladies .

Lavinia , how say you ?

I say , no ;
I have been broad awake two hours and more .

Come on , then ; horse and chariots let us have ,
And to our sport .

Madam , now shall ye see 
Our Roman hunting .

I have dogs , my lord ,
Will rouse the proudest panther in the chase ,
And climb the highest promontory top .

And I have horse will follow where the game 
Makes way , and run like swallows o'er the plain .

Chiron , we hunt not , we , with horse nor hound ,
But hope to pluck a dainty doe to ground .


He that had wit would think that I had none ,
To bury so much gold under a tree ,
And never after to inherit it .
Let him that thinks of me so abjectly 
Know that this gold must coin a stratagem ,
Which , cunningly effected , will beget 
A very excellent piece of villany :
And so repose , sweet gold , for their unrest 
That have their alms out of the empress' chest .

My lovely Aaron , wherefore look'st thou sad ,
When every thing doth make a gleeful boast ?
The birds chant melody on every bush ,
The snake lies rolled in the cheerful sun ,
The green leaves quiver with the cooling wind ,
And make a chequer'd shadow on the ground .
Under their sweet shade , Aaron , let us sit ,
And , whilst the babbling echo mocks the hounds ,
Replying shrilly to the well-tun'd horns ,
As if a double hunt were heard at once ,
Let us sit down and mark their yelping noise ;
And after conflict , such as was suppos'd 
The wandering prince and Dido once enjoy'd ,
When with a happy storm they were surpris'd ,
And curtain'd with a counsel-keeping cave ,
We may , each wreathed in the other's arms ,
Our pastimes done , possess a golden slumber ;
Whiles hounds and horns and sweet melodious birds 
Be unto us as is a nurse's song 
Of lullaby to bring her babe asleep .

Madam , though Venus govern your desires ,
Saturn is dominator over mine :
What signifies my deadly-standing eye ,
My silence and my cloudy melancholy ;
My fleece of woolly hair that now uncurls 
Even as an adder when she doth unroll 
To do some fatal execution ?
No , madam , these are no venereal signs :
Vengeance is in my heart , death in my hand ,
Blood and revenge are hammering in my head .
Hark , Tamora , the empress of my soul ,
Which never hopes more heaven than rests in thee ,
This is the day of doom for Bassianus ;
His Philomel must lose her tongue to-day ,
Thy sons make pillage of her chastity ,
And wash their hands in Bassianus' blood .
Seest thou this letter ? take it up , I pray thee ,
And give the king this fatal-plotted scroll .
Now question me no more ; we are espied ;
Here comes a parcel of our hopeful booty ,
Which dreads not yet their lives' destruction .

Ah , my sweet Moor , sweeter to me than life .

No more , great empress ; Bassianus comes :
Be cross with him ; and I'll go fetch thy sons 
To back thy quarrels , whatsoe'er they be .

Who have we here ? Rome's royal empress ,
Unfurnish'd of her well-beseeming troop ?
Or is it Dian , habited like her ,
Who hath abandoned her holy groves ,
To see the general hunting in this forest ?

Saucy controller of our private steps !
Had I the power that some say Dian had ,
Thy temples should be planted presently 
With horns , as was Act on's ; and the hounds 
Should drive upon thy new-transformed limbs ,
Unmannerly intruder as thou art !

Under your patience , gentle empress ,
'Tis thought you have a goodly gift in horning ;
And to be doubted that your Moor and you 
Are singled forth to try experiments .
Jove shield your husband from his hounds to-day !
'Tis pity they should take him for a stag .

Believe me , queen , your swarth Cimmerian 
Doth make your honour of his body's hue ,
Spotted , detested , and abominable .
Why are you sequester'd from all your train ,
Dismounted from your snow-white goodly steed ,
And wander'd hither to an obscure plot ,
Accompanied but with a barbarous Moor ,
If foul desire had not conducted you ?

And , being intercepted in your sport ,
Great reason that my noble lord be rated 
For sauciness . I pray you , let us hence ,
And let her joy her raven-colour'd love ;
This valley fits the purpose passing well .

The king my brother shall have note of this .

Ay , for these slips have made him noted long :
Good king , to be so mightily abus'd !

Why have I patience to endure all this ?


How now , dear sovereign , and our gracious mother !
Why doth your highness look so pale and wan ?

Have I not reason , think you , to look pale ?
These two have 'tic'd me hither to this place :
A barren detested vale , you see , it is ;
The trees , though summer , yet forlorn and lean ,
O'ercome with moss and baleful mistletoe :
Here never shines the sun ; here nothing breeds ,
Unless the nightly owl or fatal raven :
And when they show'd me this abhorred pit ,
They told me , here , at dead time of the night ,
A thousand fiends , a thousand hissing snakes ,
Ten thousand swelling toads , as many urchins ,
Would make such fearful and confused cries ,
As any mortal body hearing it 
Should straight fall mad , or else die suddenly .
No sooner had they told this hellish tale ,
But straight they told me they would bind me here 
Unto the body of a dismal yew ,
And leave me to this miserable death :
And then they called me foul adulteress ,
Lascivious Goth , and all the bitterest terms 
That ever ear did hear to such effect ;
And , had you not by wondrous fortune come ,
This vengeance on me had they executed .
Revenge it , as you love your mother's life ,
Or be ye not henceforth call'd my children .

This is a witness that I am thy son .


And this for me , struck home to show my strength .


Ay , come , Semiramis , nay , barbarous Tamora ;
For no name fits thy nature but thy own .

Give me thy poniard ; you shall know , my boys ,
Your mother's hand shall right your mother's wrong .

Stay , madam ; here is more belongs to her :
First thrash the corn , than after burn the straw .
This minion stood upon her chastity ,
Upon her nuptial vow , her loyalty ,
And with that painted hope she braves your mightiness :
And shall she carry this unto her grave ?

An if she do , I would I were an eunuch .
Drag hence her husband to some secret hole ,
And make his dead trunk pillow to our lust .

But when ye have the honey ye desire ,
Let not this wasp outlive , us both to sting .

I warrant you , madam , we will make that sure .
Come , mistress , now perforce we will enjoy 
That nice-preserved honesty of yours .

O Tamora , thou bear'st a woman's face ,

I will not hear her speak ; away with her !

Sweet lords , entreat her hear me but a word .

Listen , fair madam : let it be your glory 
To see her tears ; but be your heart to them 
As unrelenting flint to drops of rain .

When did the tiger's young ones teach the dam ?
O , do not learn her wrath ; she taught it thee ;
The milk thou suck'dst from her did turn to marble ;
Even at thy teat thou hadst thy tyranny .
Yet every mother breeds not sons alike :


Do thou entreat her show a woman pity .

What , wouldst thou have me prove myself a bastard ?

'Tis true , the raven doth not hatch a lark :
Yet have I heard , O , could I find it now ,
The lion mov'd with pity did endure 
To have his princely paws par'd all away .
Some say that ravens foster forlorn children ,
The whilst their own birds famish in their nests :
O , be to me , though thy hard heart say no ,
Nothing so kind , but something pitiful .

I know not what it means ; away with her !

O , let me teach thee , for my father's sake ,
That gave thee life when well he might have slain thee ,
Be not obdurate , open thy deaf ears .

Hadst thou in person ne'er offended me ,
Even for his sake am I pitiless .
Remember , boys , I pour'd forth tears in vain 
To save your brother from the sacrifice ;
But fierce Andronicus would not relent :
Therefore , away with her , and use her as you will :
The worse to her , the better lov'd of me .

O Tamora , be call'd a gentle queen ,
And with thine own hands kill me in this place ;
For 'tis not life that I have begg'd so long ;
Poor I was slain when Bassianus died .

What begg'st thou then ? fond woman , let me go .

'Tis present death I beg ; and one thing more 
That womanhood denies my tongue to tell .
O , keep me from their worse than killing lust ,
And tumble me into some loathsome pit ,
Where never man's eye may behold my body :
Do this , and be a charitable murderer .

So should I rob my sweet sons of their fee :
No , let them satisfy their lust on thee .

Away , for thou hast stay'd us here too long .

No grace , no womanhood , Ah , beastly creature ,
The blot and enemy to our general name .
Confusion fall 

Nay , then I'll stop your mouth . Bring thou her husband :
This is the hole where Aaron bid us hide him .

Farewell , my sons : see that you make her sure .
Ne'er let my heart know merry cheer indeed 
Till all the Andronici be made away .
Now will I hence to seek my lovely Moor ,
And let my spleenful sons this trull deflower .

Come on , my lords , the better foot before :
Straight will I bring you to the loathsome pit 
Where I espied the panther fast asleep .

My sight is very dull , whate'er it bodes .

And mine , I promise you : were't not for shame ,
Well could I leave our sport to sleep awhile .


What , art thou fall'n ? What subtle hole is this ,
Whose mouth is cover'd with rude-growing briers ,
Upon whose leaves are drops of new-shed blood 
As fresh as morning's dew distill'd on flowers ?
A very fatal place it seems to me .
Speak , brother , hast thou hurt thee with the fall ?

O brother , with the dismall'st object hurt 
That ever eye with sight made heart lament .

Now will I fetch the king to find them here ,
That he thereby may give a likely guess 
How these were they that made away his brother .


Why dost not comfort me , and help me out 
From this unhallow'd and blood-stained hole ?

I am surprised with an uncouth fear ;
A chilling sweat o'erruns my trembling joints :
My heart suspects more than mine eye can see .

To prove thou hast a true-divining heart ,
Aaron and thou look down into this den ,
And see a fearful sight of blood and death .

Aaron is gone ; and my compassionate heart 
Will not permit mine eyes once to behold 
The thing whereat it trembles by surmise .
O , tell me how it is ; for ne'er till now 
Was I a child , to fear I know not what .

Lord Bassianus lies embrewed here ,
All on a heap , like to a slaughter'd lamb ,
In this detested , dark , blood-drinking pit .

If it be dark , how dost thou know 'tis he ?

Upon his bloody finger he doth wear 
A precious ring , that lightens all the hole ,
Which , like a taper in some monument ,
Doth shine upon the dead man's earthy cheeks ,
And shows the ragged entrails of the pit :
So pale did shine the moon on Pyramus 
When he by night lay bath'd in maiden blood .
O brother , help me with thy fainting hand ,
If fear hath made thee faint , as me it hath ,
Out of this fell devouring receptacle ,
As hateful as Cocytus' misty mouth .

Reach me thy hand , that I may help thee out ;
Or , wanting strength to do thee so much good 
I may be pluck'd into the swallowing womb 
Of this deep pit , poor Bassianus' grave .
I have no strength to pluck thee to the brink .

Nor I no strength to climb without thy help .

Thy hand once more ; I will not loose again ,
Till thou art here aloft , or I below .
Thou canst not come to me : I come to thee .

Along with me : I'll see what hole is here ,
And what he is that now is leap'd into it .
Say , who art thou that lately didst descend 
Into this gaping hollow of the earth ?

The unhappy son of old Andronicus ;
Brought hither in a most unlucky hour ,
To find thy brother Bassianus dead .

My brother dead , I know thou dost but jest :
He and his lady both are at the lodge ,
Upon the north side of this pleasant chase ;
'Tis not an hour since I left him there .

We know not where you left him all alive ;
But , out alas , here have we found him dead .


Where is my lord , the king ?

Here , Tamora ; though griev'd with killing grief .

Where is thy brother Bassianus ?

Now to the bottom dost thou search my wound :
Poor Bassianus here lies murdered .

Then all too late I bring this fatal writ ,

The complot of this timeless tragedy ;
And wonder greatly that man's face can fold 
In pleasing smiles such murderous tyranny .

And if we miss to meet him handsomely ,
Sweet huntsman , Bassianus 'tis we mean ,
Do thou so much as dig the grave for him :
Thou know'st our meaning . Look for thy reward 
Among the nettles at the elder-tree 
Which overshades the mouth of that same pit 
Where we decreed to bury Bassianus :
Do this , and purchase us thy lasting friends .
O Tamora , was ever heard the like ?
This is the pit , and this the elder-tree .
Look , sirs , if you can find the huntsman out 
That should have murder'd Bassianus here .

My gracious lord , here is the bag of gold .

Two of thy whelps , fell curs of bloody kind ,
Have here bereft my brother of his life .
Sirs , drag them from the pit unto the prison :
There let them bide until we have devis'd 
Some never-heard-of torturing pain for them .

What , are they in this pit ? O wondrous thing !
How easily murder is discovered !

High emperor , upon my feeble knee 
I beg this boon with tears not lightly shed ;
That this fell fault of my accursed sons ,
Accursed , if the fault be prov'd in them ,

If it be prov'd , you see it is apparent .
Who found this letter ? Tamora , was it you ?

Andronicus himself did take it up .

I did , my lord : yet let me be their bail ;
For , by my father's reverend tomb , I vow 
They shall be ready at your highness' will 
To answer their suspicion with their lives .

Thou shalt not bail them : see thou follow me .
Some bring the murder'd body , some the murderers :
Let them not speak a word ; the guilt is plain ;
For , by my soul , were there worse end than death ,
That end upon them should be executed .

Andronicus , I will entreat the king :
Fear not thy sons , they shall do well enough .

Come , Lucius , come ; stay not to talk with them .


So , now go tell , an if thy tongue can speak ,
Who 'twas that cut thy tongue and ravish'd thee .

Write down thy mind , bewray thy meaning so ;
An if thy stumps will let thee play the scribe .

See , how with signs and tokens she can scrowl .

Go home , call for sweet water , wash thy hands .

She hath no tongue to call , nor hands to wash ;
And so let's leave her to her silent walks .

An 'twere my case , I should go hang myself .

If thou hadst hands to help thee knit the cord .

Who's this ? my niece , that flies away so fast ?
Cousin , a word ; where is your husband ?
If I do dream , would all my wealth would wake me !
If I do wake , some planet strike me down ,
That I may slumber in eternal sleep !
Speak , gentle niece , what stern ungentle hands 
Have lopp'd and hew'd and made thy body bare 
Of her two branches , those sweet ornaments ,
Whose circling shadows kings have sought to sleep in ,
And might not gain so great a happiness 
As have thy love ? Why dost not speak to me ?
Alas , a crimson river of warm blood ,
Like to a bubbling fountain stirr'd with wind ,
Doth rise and fall between thy rosed lips ,
Coming and going with thy honey breath .
But , sure , some Tereus hath deflower'd thee ,
And , lest thou shouldst detect him , cut thy tongue .
Ah , now thou turn'st away thy face for shame ;
And , notwithstanding all this loss of blood ,
As from a conduit with three issuing spouts ,
Yet do thy cheeks look red as Titan's face 
Blushing to be encounter'd with a cloud .
Shall I speak for thee ? shall I say 'tis so ?
O , that I knew thy heart ; and knew the beast ,
That I might rail at him to ease my mind .
Sorrow concealed , like to an oven stopp'd ,
Doth burn the heart to cinders where it is .
Fair Philomela , she but lost her tongue ,
And in a tedious sampler sew'd her mind :
But , lovely niece , that mean is cut from thee ;
A craftier Tereus hast thou met withal ,
And he hath cut those pretty fingers off ,
That could have better sew'd than Philomel .
O , had the monster seen those lily hands 
Tremble , like aspen-leaves , upon a lute ,
And make the silken strings delight to kiss them ,
He would not , then , have touch'd them for his life ;
Or had he heard the heavenly harmony 
Which that sweet tongue hath made ,
He would have dropp'd his knife , and fell asleep ,
As Cerberus at the Thracian poet's feet .
Come , let us go , and make thy father blind ;
For such a sight will blind a father's eye :
One hour's storm will drown the fragrant meads ;
What will whole months of tears thy father's eyes ?
Do not draw back , for we will mourn with thee :
O , could our mourning ease thy misery .

Hear me , grave fathers , noble tribunes , stay !
For pity of mine age , whose youth was spent 
In dangerous wars , whilst you securely slept ;
For all my blood in Rome's great quarrel shed ;
For all the frosty nights that I have watch'd ;
And for these bitter tears , which now you see 
Filling the aged wrinkles in my cheeks ;
Be pitiful to my condemned sons ,
Whose souls are not corrupted as 'tis thought .
For two and twenty sons I never wept ,
Because they died in honour's lofty bed .
For these , these , tribunes , in the dust I write 

My heart's deep languor and my soul's sad tears .
Let my tears stanch the earth's dry appetite ;
My sons' sweet blood will make it shame and blush .

O earth , I will befriend thee more with rain ,
That shall distil from these two ancient urns ,
Than youthful April shall with all his showers :
In summer's drought I'll drop upon thee still ;
In winter with warm tears I'll melt the snow ,
And keep eternal spring-time on thy face ,
So thou refuse to drink my dear sons' blood .


O reverend tribunes , O gentle , aged men !
Unbind my sons , reverse the doom of death :
And let me say , that never wept before ,

My tears are now prevailing orators .

O noble father , you lament in vain :
The tribunes hear you not , no man is by ;
And you recount your sorrows to a stone .

Ah , Lucius , for thy brothers let me plead .
Grave tribunes , once more I entreat of you ,

My gracious lord , no tribune hears you speak .

Why , 'tis no matter , man : if they did hear ,
They would not mark me , or if they did mark ,
They would not pity me , yet plead I must ,
All bootless unto them .
Therefore I tell my sorrows to the stones ,
Who , though they cannot answer my distress ,
Yet in some sort they are better than the tribunes ,
For that they will not intercept my tale .
When I do weep , they humbly at my feet 
Receive my tears , and seem to weep with me ;
And , were they but attired in grave weeds ,
Rome could afford no tribune like to these .
A stone is soft as wax , tribunes more hard than stones ;
A stone is silent , and offendeth not ,
And tribunes with their tongues doom men to death .

But wherefore stand'st thou with thy weapon drawn ?

To rescue my two brothers from their death ;
For which attempt the judges have pronounc'd 
My everlasting doom of banishment .

O happy man , they have befriended thee .
Why , foolish Lucius , dost thou not perceive 
That Rome is but a wilderness of tigers ?
Tigers must prey ; and Rome affords no prey 
But me and mine : how happy art thou then ,
From these devourers to be banished !
But who comes with our brother Marcus here ?


Titus , prepare thy aged eyes to weep ;
Or , if not so , thy noble heart to break :
I bring consuming sorrow to thine age .

Will it consume me ? let me see it then .

This was thy daughter .

Why , Marcus , so she is .

Ay me , this object kills me .

Faint-hearted boy , arise , and look upon her .
Speak , Lavinia , what accursed hand 
Hath made thee handless in thy father's sight ?
What fool hath added water to the sea ,
Or brought a faggot to bright-burning Troy ?
My grief was at the height before thou cam'st ;
And now , like Nilus , it disdaineth bounds .
Give me a sword , I'll chop off my hands too ;
For they have fought for Rome , and all in vain ;
And they have nurs'd this woe , in feeding life ;
In bootless prayer have they been held up ,
And they have serv'd me to effectless use :
Now all the service I require of them 
Is that the one will help to cut the other .
'Tis well , Lavinia , that thou hast no hands ,
For hands , to do Rome service , are but vain .

Speak , gentle sister , who hath martyr'd thee ?

O , that delightful engine of her thoughts ,
That blabb'd them with such pleasing eloquence ,
Is torn from forth that pretty hollow cage ,
Where , like a sweet melodious bird , it sung 
Sweet varied notes , enchanting every ear .

O , say thou for her , who hath done this deed ?

O , thus I found her straying in the park ,
Seeking to hide herself , as doth the deer ,
That hath receiv'd some unrecuring wound .

It was my dear ; and he that wounded her 
Hath hurt me more than had he kill'd me dead :
For now I stand as one upon a rock 
Environ'd with a wilderness of sea ,
Who marks the waxing tide grow wave by wave ,
Expecting ever when some envious surge 
Will in his brinish bowels swallow him .
This way to death my wretched sons are gone ;
Here stands my other son , a banish'd man ,
And here my brother , weeping at my woes :
But that which gives my soul the greatest spurn ,
Is dear Lavinia , dearer than my soul .
Had I but seen thy picture in this plight 
It would have madded me : what shall I do 
Now I behold thy lively body so ?
Thou hast no hands to wipe away thy tears ,
Nor tongue to tell me who hath martyr'd thee :
Thy husband he is dead , and for his death 
Thy brothers are condemn'd , and dead by this .
Look , Marcus ; ah , son Lucius , look on her :
When I did name her brothers , then fresh tears 
Stood on her cheeks , as doth the honey-dew 
Upon a gather'd lily almost wither'd .

Perchance she weeps because they kill'd her husband ;
Perchance because she knows them innocent .

If they did kill thy husband , then be joyful ,
Because the law hath ta'en revenge on them .
No , no , they would not do so foul a deed ;
Witness the sorrow that their sister makes .
Gentle Lavinia , let me kiss thy lips ;
Or make some sign how I may do thee ease .
Shall thy good uncle , and thy brother Lucius ,
And thou , and I , sit round about some fountain ,
Looking all downwards , to behold our cheeks 
How they are stain'd , like meadows yet not dry ,
With miry alime left on them by a flood ?
And in the fountain shall we gaze so long 
Till the fresh taste be taken from that clearness ,
And made a brine-pit with our bitter tears ?
Or shall we cut away our hands , like thine ?
Or shall we bite our tongues , and in dumb shows 
Pass the remainder of our hateful days ?
What shall we do ? let us , that have our tongues ,
Plot some device of further misery ,
To make us wonder'd at in time to come .

Sweet father , cease your tears ; for at your grief 
See how my wretched sister sobs and weeps .

Patience , dear niece . Good Titus , dry thine eyes .

Ah , Marcus , Marcus , brother ; well I wot 
Thy napkin cannot drink a tear of mine ,
For thou , poor man , hast drown'd it with thine own .

Ah , my Lavinia , I will wipe thy cheeks .

Mark , Marcus , mark , I understand her signs :
Had she a tongue to speak , now would she say 
That to her brother which I said to thee :
His napkin , with his true tears all bewet ,
Can do no service on her sorrowful cheeks .
O , what a sympathy of woe is this ;
As far from help as limbo is from bliss .


Titus Andronicus , my lord the emperor 
Sends thee this word : that , if thou love thy sons ,
Let Marcus , Lucius , or thyself , old Titus ,
Or any one of you , chop off your hand ,
And send it to the king : he for the same 
Will send thee hither both thy sons alive ;
And that shall be the ransom for their fault .

O gracious emperor , O gentle Aaron !
Did ever raven sing so like a lark ,
That gives sweet tidings of the sun's uprise ?
With all my heart , I'll send the emperor my hand :
Good Aaron , wilt thou help to chop it off ?

Stay , father , for that noble hand of thine ,
That hath thrown down so many enemies ,
Shall not be sent ; my hand will serve the turn :
My youth can better spare my blood than you ;
And therefore mine shall save my brothers' lives .

Which of your hands hath not defended Rome ,
And rear'd aloft the bloody battle-axe ,
Writing destruction on the enemy's castle ?
O , none of both but are of high desert :
My hand hath been but idle ; let it serve 
To ransom my two nephews from their death ;
Then have I kept it to a worthy end .

Nay , come , agree whose hand shall go along ,
For fear they die before their pardon come .

My hand shall go .

By heaven , it shall not go !

Sirs , strive no more : such wither'd herbs as these 
Are meet for plucking up , and therefore mine .

Sweet father , if I shall be thought thy son ,
Let me redeem my brothers both from death .

And for our father's sake , and mother's care ,
Now let me show a brother's love to thee .

Agree between you ; I will spare my hand .

Then I'll go fetch an axe .

But I will use the axe .


Come hither , Aaron ; I'll deceive them both :
Lend me thy hand , and I will give thee mine .

If that be call'd deceit , I will be honest ,
And never , whilst I live , deceive men so :
But I'll deceive you in another sort ,
And that you'll say , ere half an hour pass .

Now stay your strife : what shall be is dispatch'd .
Good Aaron , give his majesty my hand :
Tell him it was a hand that warded him 
From thousand dangers ; bid him bury it ;
More hath it merited ; that let it have .
As for my sons , say I account of them 
As jewels purchas'd at an easy price ;
And yet dear too , because I bought mine own .

I go , Andronicus ; and for thy hand ,
Look by and by to have thy sons with thee .


Their heads , I mean . O , how this villany 
Doth fat me with the very thoughts of it .
Let fools do good , and fair men call for grace ,
Aaron will have his soul black like his face .


O , here I lift this one hand up to heaven ,
And how this feeble ruin to the earth :
If any power pities wretched tears ,
To that I call !

What , wilt thou kneel with me ?
Do , then , dear heart ; for heaven shall hear our prayers ,
Or with our sighs we'll breathe the welkin dim ,
And stain the sun with fog , as sometime clouds 
When they do hug him in their melting bosoms .

O , brother , speak with possibilities ,
And do not break into these deep extremes .

Is not my sorrow deep , having no bottom ?
Then be my passions bottomless with them .

But yet let reason govern thy lament .

If there were reason for these miseries ,
Then into limits could I bind my woes .
When heaven doth weep , doth not the earth o'erflow ?
If the winds rage , doth not the sea wax mad ,
Threat'ning the welkin with his big-swoln face ?
And wilt thou have a reason for this coil ?
I am the sea ; hark , how her sighs do blow ;
She is the weeping welkin , I the earth :
Then must my sea be moved with her sighs ;
Then must my earth with her continual tears 
Become a deluge , overflow'd and drown'd ;
For why my bowels cannot hide her woes ,
But like a drunkard must I vomit them .
Then give me leave , for losers will have leave 
To ease their stomachs with their bitter tongues .


Worthy Andronicus , ill art thou repaid 
For that good hand thou sent'st the emperor .
Here are the heads of thy two noble sons ,
And here's thy hand , in scorn to thee sent back :
Thy griefs their sports , thy resolution mock'd ;
That woe is me to think upon thy woes ,
More than remembrance of my father's death .


Now let hot  tna cool in Sicily ,
And be my heart an ever burning hell !
These miseries are more than may be borne .
To weep with them that weep doth ease some deal ,
But sorrow flouted at is double death .

Ah , that this sight should make so deep a wound ,
And yet detested life not shrink thereat ,
That ever death should let life bear his name ,
Where life hath no more interest but to breathe .


Alas , poor heart ; that kiss is comfortless 
As frozen water to a starved snake .

When will this fearful slumber have an end ?

Now , farewell , flattery : die , Andronicus ;
Thou dost not slumber : see , thy two sons' heads ,
Thy war-like hand , thy mangled daughter here ;
Thy other banish'd son , with this dear sight 
Struck pale and bloodless ; and thy brother , I ,
Even like a stony image , cold and numb .
Ah , now no more will I control thy griefs .
Rent off thy silver hair , thy other hand 
Gnawing with thy teeth ; and be this dismal sight 
The closing up of our most wretched eyes !
Now is a time to storm ; why art thou still ?

Ha , ha , ha !

Why dost thou laugh ? it fits not with this hour .

Why , I have not another tear to shed :
Besides , this sorrow is an enemy ,
And would usurp upon my watery eyes ,
And make them blind with tributary tears :
Then which way shall I find Revenge's cave ?
For these two heads do seem to speak to me ,
And threat me I shall never come to bliss 
Till all these mischiefs be return'd again 
Even in their throats that have committed them .
Come , let me see what task I have to do .
You heavy people , circle me about ,
That I may turn me to each one of you ,
And swear unto my soul to right your wrongs .
The vow is made . Come , brother , take a head ;
And in this hand the other will I bear .
Lavinia , thou shalt be employ'd in these things :
Bear thou my hand , sweet wench , between thy teeth .
As for thee , boy , go get thee from my sight ;
Thou art an exile , and thou must not stay :
Hie to the Goths , and raise an army there :
And if you love me , as I think you do ,
Let's kiss and part , for we have much to do .


Farewell , Andronicus , my noble father ;
The woefull'st man that ever liv'd in Rome :
Farewell , proud Rome ; till Lucius come again ,
He leaves his pledges dearer than his life .
Farewell , Lavinia , my noble sister ;
O , would thou wert as thou tofore hast been ;
But now nor Lucius nor Lavinia lives 
But in oblivion and hateful griefs .
If Lucius live , he will requite your wrongs ,
And make proud Saturnine and his empress 
Beg at the gates like Tarquin and his queen .
Now will I to the Goths , and raise a power ,
To be reveng'd on Rome and Saturnine .


So , so ; now sit ; and look you eat no more 
Than will preserve just so much strength in us 
As will revenge these bitter woes of ours .
Marcus , unknit that sorrow-wreathen knot :
Thy niece and I , poor creatures , want our hands ,
And cannot passionate our ten-fold grief 
With folded arms . This poor right hand of mine 
Is left to tyrannize upon my breast ;
And when my heart , all mad with misery ,
Beats in this hollow prison of my flesh ,
Then thus I thump it down .


Thou map of woe , that thus dost talk in signs !
When thy poor heart beats with outrageous beating 
Thou canst not strike it thus to make it still .
Wound it with sighing , girl , kill it with groans ;
Or get some little knife between thy teeth ,
And just against thy heart make thou a hole ;
That all the tears that thy poor eyes let fall 
May run into that sink , and , soaking in ,
Drown the lamenting fool in sea-salt tears .

Fie , brother , fie , teach her not thus to lay 
Such violent hands upon her tender life .

How now , has sorrow made thee dote already ?
Why , Marcus , no man should be mad but I .
What violent hands can she lay on her life ?
Ah , wherefore dost thou urge the name of hands ;
To bid  aeas tell the tale twice o'er ,
How Troy was burnt and he made miserable ?
O , handle not the theme , to talk of hands ,
Lest we remember still that we have none .
Fie , fie , how franticly I square my talk ,
As if we should forget we had no hands ,
If Marcus did not name the word of hands .
Come , let's fall to ; and , gentle girl , eat this :
Here is no drink . Hark , Marcus , what she says ;
I can interpret all her martyr'd signs :
She says she drinks no other drink but tears ,
Brew'd with her sorrow , mash'd upon her cheeks .
Speechless complainer , I will learn thy thought ;
In thy dumb action will I be as perfect 
As begging hermits in their holy prayers :
Thou shalt not sigh , nor hold thy stumps to heaven ,
Nor wink , nor nod , nor kneel , nor make a sign ,
But I of these will wrest an alphabet ,
And by still practice learn to know thy meaning .

Good grandsire , leave these bitter deep laments :
Make my aunt merry with some pleasing tale .

Alas , the tender boy , in passion mov'd ,
Doth weep to see his grandsire's heaviness .

Peace , tender sapling ; thou art made of tears ,
And tears will quickly melt thy life away .

What dost thou strike at , Marcus , with thy knife ?

At that that I have kill'd , my lord ; a fly .

Out on thee , murderer , thou kill'st my heart ;
Mine eyes are cloy'd with view of tyranny :
A deed of death , done on the innocent ,
Becomes not Titus' brother . Get thee gone ;
I see , thou art not for my company .

Alas , my lord , I have but kill'd a fly .

But how if that fly had a father and a mother ?
How would he hang his slender gilded wings 
And buzz lamenting doings in the air !
Poor harmless fly ,
That , with his pretty buzzing melody ,
Came here to make us merry , and thou hast kill'd him .

Pardon me , sir ; it was a black ill-favour'd fly ,
Like to the empress' Moor ; therefore I kill'd him .

O , O , O !
Then pardon me for reprehending thee ,
For thou hast done a charitable deed .
Give me thy knife , I will insult on him ;
Flattering myself , as if it were the Moor 
Come hither purposely to poison me .
There's for thyself , and that's for Tamora .
Ah , sirrah .
Yet I think we are not brought so low ,
But that between us we can kill a fly 
That comes in likeness of a coal-black Moor .

Alas , poor man ; grief has so wrought on him ,
He takes false shadows for true substances .

Come , take away . Lavinia , go with me :
I'll to thy closet ; and go read with thee 
Sad stories chanced in the times of old .
Come , boy , and go with me : thy sight is young ,
And thou shalt read when mine begins to dazzle .

Help , grandsire , help , my aunt Lavinia 
Follows me everywhere , I know not why :
Good uncle Marcus , see how swift she comes :
Alas , sweet aunt , I know not what you mean .

Stand by me , Lucius ; do not fear thine aunt .

She loves thee , boy , too well to do thee harm .

Ay , when my father was in Rome , she did .

What means my niece Lavinia by these signs ?

Fear her not , Lucius : somewhat doth she mean .
See , Lucius , see how much she makes of thee ;
Somewhither would she have thee go with her .
Ah , boy ; Cornelia never with more care 
Read to her sons , than she hath read to thee 
Sweet poetry and Tully's Orator .

Canst thou not guess wherefore she plies thee thus ?

My lord , I know not , I , nor can I guess ,
Unless some fit or frenzy do possess her ;
For I have heard my grandsire say full oft ,
Extremity of griefs would make men mad ;
And I have read that Hecuba of Troy 
Ran mad through sorrow ; that made me to fear ,
Although , my lord , I know my noble aunt 
Loves me as dear as e'er my mother did ,
And would not , but in fury , fright my youth ;
Which made me down to throw my books and fly ,
Causeless , perhaps . But pardon me , sweet aunt ;
And , madam , if my uncle Marcus go ,
I will most willingly attend your ladyship .

Lucius , I will .


How now , Lavinia , Marcus , what means this ?
Some book there is that she desires to see .
Which is it , girl , of these ? Open them , boy .
But thou art deeper read , and better skill'd ;
Come , and take choice of all my library ,
And so beguile thy sorrow , till the heavens 
Reveal the damn'd contriver of this deed .
Why lifts she up her arms in sequence thus ?

I think she means that there was more than one 
Confederate in the fact : ay , more there was ;
Or else to heaven she heaves them for revenge .

Lucius ; what book is that she tosseth so ?

Grandsire , 'tis Ovid's Metamorphoses ;
My mother gave it me .

For love of her that's gone ,
Perhaps , she cull'd it from among the rest .

Soft , see how busily she turns the leaves !

What would she find ? Lavinia , shall I read ?
This is the tragic tale of Philomel ,
And treats of Tereus' treason and his rape ;
And rape , I fear , was root of thine annoy .

See , brother , see , note how she quotes the leaves .

Lavinia , wert thou thus surpris'd , sweet girl ,
Ravish'd and wrong'd , as Philomela was ,
Forc'd in the ruthless , vast , and gloomy woods ?
See , see !
Ay , such a place there is , where we did hunt ,
O , had we never , never hunted there ,
Pattern'd by that the poet here describes ,
By nature made for murders and for rapes .

O , why should nature build so foul a den ,
Unless the gods delight in tragedies ?

Give signs , sweet girl , for here are none but friends ,
What Roman lord it was durst do the deed :
Or slunk not Saturnine , as Tarquin erst ,
That left the camp to sin in Lucrece' bed ?

Sit down , sweet niece : brother , sit down by me .
Apollo , Pallas , Jove , or Mercury ,
Inspire me , that I may this treason find !
My lord , look here ; look here , Lavinia :
This sandy plot is plain ; guide , if thou canst ,
This after me .

I have writ my name 
Without the help of any hand at all .
Curs'd be that heart that forc'd us to this shift !
Write thou , good niece , and here display at last 
What God will have discover'd for revenge .
Heaven guide thy pen to print thy sorrows plain ,
That we may know the traitors and the truth !


O , do you read , my lord , what she hath writ ?
Stuprum , Chiron , Demetrius .

What , what , the lustful sons of Tamora 
Performers of this heinous , bloody deed ?

Magni dominator poli ,
Tam lentus audis scelera ? tam lentus vides ?

O , calm thee , gentle lord ; although I know 
There is enough written upon this earth 
To stir a mutiny in the mildest thoughts 
And arm the minds of infants to exclaims .
My lord , kneel down with me ; Lavinia , kneel ;
And kneel , sweet boy , the Roman Hector's hope ;
And swear with me , as , with the woeful fere 
And father of that chaste dishonour'd dame ,
Lord Junius Brutus sware for Lucrece' rape ,
That we will prosecute by good advice 
Mortal revenge upon these traitorous Goths ,
And see their blood , or die with this reproach .

'Tis sure enough , an you knew how ;
But if you hunt these bear-whelps , then beware :
The dam will wake , an if she wind you once :
She's with the lion deeply still in league ,
And lulls him whilst she playeth on her back ,
And when he sleeps will she do what she list .
You're a young huntsman , Marcus ; let it alone ;
And , come , I will go get a leaf of brass ,
And with a gad of steel will write these words ,
And lay it by : the angry northern wind 
Will blow these sands like Sibyl's leaves abroad ,
And where's your lesson then ? Boy , what say you ?

I say , my lord , that if I were a man ,
Their mother's bed-chamber should not be safe 
For these bad bondmen to the yoke of Rome .

Ay , that's my boy , thy father hath full oft 
For his ungrateful country done the like .

And , uncle , so will I , an if I live .

Come , go with me into mine armoury :
Lucius , I'll fit thee ; and withal my boy 
Shall carry from me to the empress' sons 
Presents that I intend to send them both :
Come , come ; thou'lt do thy message , wilt thou not ?

Ay , with my dagger in their bosoms , grandsire .

No , boy , not so ; I'll teach thee another course .
Lavinia , come . Marcus , look to my house ;
Lucius and I'll go brave it at the court :
Ay , marry , will we , sir ; and we'll be waited on .


O heavens , can you hear a good man groan ,
And not relent or not compassion him ?
Marcus , attend him in his ecstasy ,
That hath more scars of sorrow in his heart 
Than foemen's marks upon his batter'd shield ;
But yet so just that he will not revenge .
Revenge , ye heavens , for old Andronicus !


Demetrius , here's the son of Lucius ;
He hath some message to deliver us .

Ay , some mad message from his mad grandfather .

My lords , with all the humbleness I may ,
I greet your honours from Andronicus ;


And pray the Roman gods , confound you both !

Gramercy , lovely Lucius : what's the news ?

That you are both decipher'd , that's the news ,
For villains mark'd with rape .

May it please you ,
My grandsire , well advis'd , hath sent by me 
The goodliest weapons of his armoury ,
To gratify your honourable youth ,
The hope of Rome , for so he bade me say ;
And so I do , and with his gifts present 
Your lordships , that whenever you have need ,
You may be armed and appointed well .
And so I leave you both :

like bloody villains .


What's here ? A scroll ; and written round about ?
Let's see :

'Integer vit , scelerisque purus ,
Non eget Mauri jaculis , nec arcu .


O , 'tis a verse in Horace ; I know it well :
I read it in the grammar long ago .

Ay just , a verse in Horace ; right , you have it .


Now , what a thing it is to be an ass !
Here's no sound jest , the old man hath found their guilt 
And sends them weapons wrapp'd about with lines ,
That wound , beyond their feeling , to the quick ;
But were our witty empress well afoot ,
She would applaud Andronicus' conceit :
But let her rest in her unrest awhile .


And now , young lords , was't not a happy star 
Led us to Rome , strangers , and more than so ,
Captives , to be advanced to this height ?
It did me good before the palace gate 
To brave the tribune in his brother's hearing .

But me more good , to see so great a lord 
Basely insinuate and send us gifts .

Had he not reason , Lord Demetrius ?
Did you not use his daughter very friendly ?

I would we had a thousand Roman dames 
At such a bay , by turn to serve our lust .

A charitable wish and full of love .

Here lacks but your mother for to say amen .

And that would she for twenty thousand more .

Come , let us go and pray to all the gods 
For our beloved mother in her pains .

Pray to the devils ; the gods have given us over .


Why do the emperor's trumpets flourish thus ?

Belike , for joy the emperor hath a son .

Soft , who comes here ?


Good morrow , lords . O , tell me , did you see 
Aaron the Moor ?

Well , more or less , or ne'er a whit at all ,
Here Aaron is ; and what with Aaron now ?

O gentle Aaron , we are all undone .
Now help , or woe betide thee evermore !

Why , what a caterwauling dost thou keep !
What dost thou wrap and fumble in thine arms ?

O , that which I would hide from heaven's eye ,
Our empress' shame , and stately Rome's disgrace !
She is deliver'd , lords , she is deliver'd .

To whom ?

I mean , she's brought a-bed .

Well , God give her good rest , What hath he sent her ?

A devil .

Why , then she's the devil's dam : a joyful issue .

A joyless , dismal , black , and sorrowful issue .
Here is the babe , as loathsome as a toad 
Amongst the fairest breeders of our clime .
The empress sends it thee , thy stamp , thy seal ,
And bids thee christen it with thy dagger's point .

'Zounds , ye whore , is black so base a hue ?
Sweet blowse , you are a beauteous blossom , sure .

Villain , what hast thou done ?

That which thou canst not undo .

Thou hast undone our mother .

Villain , I have done thy mother .

And therein , hellish dog , thou hast undone .
Woe to her chance , and damn'd her loathed choice !
Accurs'd the offspring of so foul a fiend !

It shall not live .

It shall not die .

Aaron , it must ; the mother wills it so .

What , must it , nurse ? then let no man but I 
Do execution on my flesh and blood .

I'll broach the tadpole on my rapier's point :
Nurse , give it me ; my sword shall soon dispatch it .

Sooner this sword shall plough thy bowels up .

Stay , murderous villains , will you kill your brother ?
Now , by the burning tapers of the sky ,
That shone so brightly when this boy was got ,
He dies upon my scimitar's sharp point 
That touches this my first-born son and heir .
I tell you , younglings , not Enceladus ,
With all his threatening band of Typhon's brood ,
Nor great Alcides , nor the god of war ,
Shall seize this prey out of his father's hands .
What , what , ye sanguine , shallow-hearted boys !
Ye white-lim'd walls , ye alehouse painted signs !
Coal-black is better than another hue ,
In that it scorns to bear another hue ;
For all the water in the ocean 
Can never turn the swan's black legs to white ,
Although she lave them hourly in the flood .
Tell the empress from me , I am of age 
To keep mine own , excuse it how she can .

Wilt thou betray thy noble mistress thus ?

My mistress is my mistress ; this myself ;
The vigour , and the picture of my youth :
This before all the world do I prefer ;
This maugre all the world will I keep safe ,
Or some of you shall smoke for it in Rome .

By this our mother is for ever sham'd .

Rome will despise her for this foul escape .

The emperor in his rage will doom her death .

I blush to think upon this ignomy .

Why , there's the privilege your beauty bears .
Fie , treacherous hue , that will betray with blushing 
The close enacts and counsels of the heart :
Here's a young lad fram'd of another leer :
Look how the black slavesmiles upon the father ,
As who should say , 'Old lad , I am thine own .' 
He is your brother , lords , sensibly fed 
Of that self blood that first gave life to you ;
And from that womb where you imprison'd were 
He is enfranchised and come to light :
Nay , he is your brother by the surer side ,
Although my seal be stamped in his face .

Aaron , what shall I say unto the empress ?

Advise thee , Aaron , what is to be done ,
And we will all subscribe to thy advice :
Save thou the child , so we may all be safe .

Then sit we down , and let us all consult ,
My son and I will have the wind of you :
Keep there ; now talk at pleasure of your safety .


How many women saw this child of his ?

Why , so , brave lords , when we join in league ,
I am a lamb ; but if you brave the Moor ,
The chafed boar , the mountain lioness ,
The ocean swells not so as Aaron storms .
But say , again , how many saw the child ?

Cornelia the midwife , and myself ,
And no one else but the deliver'd empress .

The empress , the midwife , and yourself :
Two may keep counsel when the third's away .
Go to the empress ; tell her this I said :

'Weke , weke !' 
So cries a pig prepared to the spit .

What mean'st thou , Aaron ? Wherefore didst thou this ?

O lord , sir , 'tis a deed of policy :
Shall she live to betray this guilt of ours ,
A long-tongu'd babbling gossip ? no , lords , no .
And now be it known to you my full intent .
Not far , one Muli lives , my countryman ;
His wife but yesternight was brought to bed .
His child is like to her , fair as you are :
Go pack with him , and give the mother gold ,
And tell them both the circumstance of all ,
And how by this their child shall be advanc'd ,
And be received for the emperor's heir ,
And substituted in the place of mine ,
To calm this tempest whirling in the court ;
And let the emperor dandle him for his own .
Hark ye , lords ; you see , I have given her physic ,

And you must needs bestow her funeral ;
The fields are near , and you are gallant grooms .
This done , see that you take no longer days ,
But send the midwife presently to me .
The midwife and the nurse well made away ,
Then let the ladies tattle what they please .

Aaron , I see thou wilt not trust the air 
With secrets .

For this care of Tamora ,
Herself and hers are highly hound to thee .


Now to the Goths , as swift as swallow flies :
There to dispose this treasure in mine arms ,
And secretly to greet the empress' friends .
Come on , you thick-lipp'd slave , I'll bear you hence ;
For it is you that puts us to our shifts :
I'll make you feed on berries and on roots ,
And feed on curds and whey , and suck the goat ,
And cabin in a cave , and bring you up 
To be a warrior , and command a camp .


Come , Marcus , come ; kinsmen , this is the way .
Sir boy , now let me see your archery :
Look ye draw home enough , and 'tis there straight .
Terras Astr a reliquit :
Be you remember'd , Marcus , she's gone , she's fled .
Sirs , take you to your tools . You , cousins , shall 
Go sound the ocean , and cast your nets ;
Happily you may find her in the sea ;
Yet there's as little justice as at land .
No ; Publius and Sempronius , you must do it ;
'Tis you must dig with mattock and with spade ,
And pierce the inmost centre of the earth :
Then , when you come to Pluto's region ,
I pray you , deliver him this petition ;
Tell him , it is for justice and for aid ,
And that it comes from old Andronicus ,
Shaken with sorrows in ungrateful Rome .
Ah , Rome . Well , well ; I made thee miserable 
What time I threw the people's suffrages 
On him that thus doth tyrannize o'er me .
Go , get you gone ; and pray be careful all ,
And leave you not a man-of-war unsearch'd :
This wicked emperor may have shipp'd her hence ;
And , kinsmen , then we may go pipe for justice .

O Publius , is not this a heavy case ,
To see thy noble uncle thus distract ?

Therefore , my lord , it highly us concerns 
By day and night to attend him carefully ,
And feed his humour kindly as we may ,
Till time beget some careful remedy .

Kinsmen , his sorrows are past remedy .
Join with the Goths , and with revengeful war 
Take wreak on Rome for this ingratitude ,
And vengeance on the traitor Saturnine .

Publius , how now , how now , my masters !
What , have you met with her ?

No , my good lord ; but Pluto sends you word ,
If you will have Revenge from hell , you shall :
Marry , for Justice , she is so employ'd ,
He thinks , with Jove in heaven , or somewhere else ,
So that perforce you must needs stay a time .

He doth me wrong to feed me with delays .
I'll dive into the burning lake below ,
And pull her out of Acheron by the heels .
Marcus , we are but shrubs , no cedars we ;
No big-bon'd men fram'd of the Cyclops' size ;
But metal , Marcus , steel to the very back ,
Yet wrung with wrongs more than our backs can bear :
And sith there's no justice in earth nor hell ,
We will solicit heaven and move the gods 
To send down Justice for to wreak our wrongs .
Come , to this gear . You are a good archer , Marcus .

Ad Javem , that's for you : here , ad Apollinem :
Ad Martem , that's for myself :
Here , boy , to Pallas : here , to Mercury :
To Saturn , Caius , not to Saturnine ;
You were as good to shoot against the wind .
To it , boy , Marcus , loose when I bid .
Of my word , I have written to effect ;
There's not a god left unsolicited .

Kinsmen , shoot all your shafts into the court :
We will afflict the emperor in his pride .

Now , masters , draw .

O , well said , Lucius !
Good boy , in Virgo's lap : give it Pallas .

My lord , I aim a mile beyond the moon ;
Your letter is with Jupiter by this .

Ha , Publius , Publius , what hast thou done ?
See , see , thou hast shot off one of Taurus' horns .

This was the sport , my lord : when Publius shot ,
The Bull , being gall'd , gave Aries such a knock 
That down fell both the Ram's horns in the court ;
And who should find them but the empress' villain ?
She laugh'd , and told the Moor , he should not choose 
But give them to his master for a present .

Why , there it goes : God give his lordship joy !


News , news from heaven , Marcus , the post is come .
Sirrah , what tidings ? have you any letters ?

Shall I have justice ? what says Jupiter ?

O , tho gibbet-maker ? He says that he hath taken them down again , for the man must not be hanged till the next week .

But what says Jupiter , I ask thee ?

Alas , sir , I know not Jupiter ; I never drank with him in all my life .

Why , villain , art not thou the carrier ?

Ay , of my pigeons , sir ; nothing else .

Why , didst thou not come from heaven ?

From heaven , alas , sir , I never came there . God forbid I should be so bold to press to heaven in my young days . Why , I am going with my pigeons to the tribunal plebs , to take up a matter of brawl betwixt my uncle and one of the emperial's men .

Why , sir , that is as fit as can be to serve for your oration ; and let him deliver the pigeons to the emperor from you .

Tell me , can you deliver an oration to the emperor with a grace ?

Nay , truly , sir , I could never say grace in all my life .

Sirrah , come hither : make no more ado ,
But give your pigeons to the emperor :
By me thou shalt have justice at his hands .
Hold , hold ; meanwhile , here's money for thy charges .
Give me pen and ink .
Sirrah , can you with a grace deliver a supplication ?

Ay , sir .

Then here is a supplication for you . And when you come to him , at the first approach you must kneel ; then kiss his foot ; then deliver up your pigeons ; and then look for your reward . I'll be at hand , sir ; see you do it bravely .

I warrant you , sir ; let me alone .

Sirrah , hast thou a knife ? Come , let me see it .
Here , Marcus , fold it in the oration ;
For thou hast made it like a humble suppliant :
And when thou hast given it to the emperor ,
Knock at my door , and tell me what he says .

God be with you , sir ; I will .

Come , Marcus , let us go . Publius , follow me .

Why , lords , what wrongs are these , Was ever seen 
An emperor of Rome thus overborne ,
Troubled , confronted thus ; and , for the extent 
Of egal justice , us'd in such contempt ?
My lords , you know , as do the mightful gods ,
However these disturbers of our peace 
Buzz in the people's ears ,there nought hath pass'd ,
But even with law , against the wilful sons 
Of old Andronicus . And what an if 
His sorrows have so overwhelm'd his wits ,
Shall we be thus afflicted in his wreaks ,
His fits , his frenzy , and his bitterness ?
And now he writes to heaven for his redress :
See , here's to Jove , and this to Mercury ;
This to Apollo ; this to the god of war ;
Sweet scrolls to fly about the streets of Rome !
What's this but libelling against the senate ,
And blazoning our injustice every where ?
A goodly humour , is it not , my lords ?
As who would say , in Rome no justice were .
But if I live , his feigned ecstasies 
Shall be no shelter to these outrages ;
But he and his shall know that justice lives 
In Saturninus' health ; whom , if she sleep ,
He'll so awake , as she in fury shall 
Cut off the proud'st conspirator that lives .

My gracious lord , my lovely Saturnine ,
Lord of my life , commander of my thoughts ,
Calm thee , and bear the faults of Titus' age ,
The effects of sorrow for his valiant sons ,
Whose loss hath pierc'd him deep and scarr'd his heart ;
And rather comfort his distressed plight 
Than prosecute the meanest or the best 
For these contempts .

Why , thus it shall become 
High-witted Tamora to gloze with all :
But , Titus , I have touch'd thee to the quick ,
Thy life-blood out : if Aaron now be wise ,
Then is all safe , the anchor's in the port .

How now , good fellow , wouldst thou speak with us ?

Yea , forsooth , an your mistership be emperial .

Empress I am , but yonder sits the emperor .

'Tis he . God and Saint Stephen give you good den .
I have brought you a letter and a couple of pigeons here .


Go , take him away , and hang him presently .

How much money must I have ?

Come , sirrah , you must be hanged .

Hanged , By 'r , lady , then I have brought up a neck to a fair end .


Despiteful and intolerable wrongs !
Shall I endure this monstrous villany ?
I know from whence this same device proceeds :
May this be borne ? As if his traitorous sons ,
That died by law for murder of our brother ,
Have by my means been butcher'd wrongfully !
Go , drag the villain hither by the hair ;
Nor age nor honour shall shape privilege .
For this proud mock I'll be thy slaughterman ;
Sly frantic wretch , that holp'st to make me great ,
In hope thyself should govern Rome and me .

What news with thee ,  milius ?

Arm , arm , my lord , Rome never had more cause .
The Goths have gather'd head , and with a power 
Of high-resolved men , bent to the spoil ,
They hither march amain , under conduct 
Of Lucius , son to old Andronicus ;
Who threats , in course of this revenge , to do 
As much as ever Coriolanus did .

Is war-like Lucius general of the Goths ?
These tidings nip me , and I hang the head 
As flowers with frost or grass beat down with storms .
Ay , now begin our sorrows to approach :
'Tis he the common people love so much ;
Myself hath often heard them say ,
When I have walked like a private man ,
That Lucius' banishment was wrongfully ,
And they have wish'd that Lucius were their emperor .

Why should you fear ? is not your city strong ?

Ay , but the citizens favour Lucius ,
And will revolt from me to succour him .

King , be thy thoughts imperious , like thy name .
Is the sun dimm'd , that gnats do fly in it ?
The eagle suffers little birds to sing ,
And is not careful what they mean thereby ,
Knowing that with the shadow of his wings 
He can at pleasure stint their melody ;
Even so mayst thou the giddy men of Rome .
Then cheer thy spirit ; for know , thou emperor ,
I will enchant the old Andronicus 
With words more sweet , and yet more dangerous ,
Than baits to fish , or honey-stalks to sheep ,
Whenas the one is wounded with the bait ,
The other rotted with delicious feed .

But he will not entreat his son for us .

If Tamora entreat him , then he will :
For I can smooth and fill his aged ear 
With golden promises , that , were his heart 
Almost impregnable , his old ears deaf ,
Yet should both ear and heart obey my tongue .


Go thou before , be our ambassador :
Say that the emperor requests a parley 
Of war-like Lucius , and appoint the meeting ,
Even at his father's house , the old Andronicus .

milius , do this message honourably :
And if he stand on hostage for his safety ,
Bid him demand what pledge will please him best .

Your bidding shall I do effectually .


Now will I to that old Andronicus ,
And temper him with all the art I have ,
To pluck proud Lucius from the war-like Goths .
And now , sweet emperor , be blithe again ,
And bury all thy fear in my devices .

Then go successantly , and plead to him .

Approved warriors , and my faithful friends ,
I have received letters from great Rome ,
Which signify what hate they bear their emperor ,
And how desirous of our sight they are .
Therefore , great lords , be , as your titles witness ,
Imperious and impatient of your wrongs ;
And wherein Rome hath done you any scath ,
Let him make treble satisfaction .

Brave slip , sprung from the great Andronicus ,
Whose name was once our terror , now our comfort ;
Whose high exploits and honourable deeds 
Ingrateful Rome requites with foul contempt ,
Be bold in us : we'll follow where thou lead'st ,
Like stinging bees in hottest summer's day 
Led by their master to the flower'd fields ,
And be aveng'd on cursed Tamora .

And , as he saith , so say we all with him .

I humbly thank him , and I thank you all .
But who comes here , led by a lusty Goth ?


Renowned Lucius , from our troops I stray'd ,
To gaze upon a ruinous monastery ;
And as I earnestly did fix mine eye 
Upon the wasted building , suddenly 
I heard a child cry underneath a wall .
I made unto the noise ; when soon I heard 
The crying babe controll'd with this discourse :
'Peace , tawny slave , half me and half thy dam !
Did not thy hue bewray whose brat thou art ,
Had nature lent thee but thy mother's look ,
Villain , thou mightst have been an emperor :
But where the bull and cow are both milk-white ,
They never do beget a coal-black calf .
Peace , villain , peace !' even thus he rates the babe ,
'For I must bear thee to a trusty Goth ;
Who , when he knows thou art the empress' babe ,
Will hold thee dearly for thy mother's sake .' 
With this , my weapon drawn , I rush'd upon him ,
Surpris'd him suddenly , and brought him hither ,
To use as you think needful of the man .

O worthy Goth , this is the incarnate devil 
That robb'd Andronicus of his good hand :
This is the pearl that pleas'd your empress' eye ,
And here's the base fruit of his burning lust .
Say , wall-ey'd slave , whither wouldst thou convey 
This growing image of thy fiend-like face ?
Why dost not speak ? What , deaf ? not a word ?
A halter , soldiers , hang him on this tree ,
And by his side his fruit of bastardy .

Touch not the boy ; he is of royal blood .

Too like the sire for ever being good .
First hang the child , that he may see it sprawl ;
A sight to vex the father's soul withal .
Get me a ladder .


Lucius , save the child ;
And bear it from me to the empress .
If thou do this , I'll show thee wondrous things ,
That highly may advantage thee to hear :
If thou wilt not , befall what may befall ,
I'll speak no more but 'Vengeance rot you all !' 

Say on ; and if it please me which thou speak'st ,
Thy child shall live , and I will see it nourish'd .

An if it please thee , why , assure thee , Lucius ,
'Twill vex'thy soul to hear what I shall speak ;
For I must talk of murders , rapes , and massacres ,
Acts of black night , abominable deeds ,
Complots of mischief , treason , villanies 
Ruthful to hear , yet piteously perform'd :
And this shall all be buried by my death ,
Unless thou swear to me my child shall live .

Tell on thy mind : I say , thy child shall live .

Swear that he shall , and then I will begin .

Who should I swear by ? thou believ'st no god :
That granted , how canst thou believe an oath ?

What if I do not ? as , indeed , I do not ;
Yet , for I know thou art religious ,
And hast a thing within thee called conscience ,
With twenty popish tricks and ceremonies ,
Which I have seen thee careful to observe ,
Therefore I urge thy oath ; for that I know 
An idiot holds his bauble for a god ,
And keeps the oath which by that god he swears ,
To that I'll urge him : therefore thou shalt vow 
By that same god , what god soe'er it be ,
That thou ador'st and hast in reverence ,
To save my boy , to nourish and bring him up :
Or else I will discover nought to thee .

Even by my god I swear to thee I will .

First , know thou , I begot him on the empress .

O most insatiate and luxurious woman !

Tut , Lucius , this was but a deed of charity 
To that which thou shalt hear of me anon .
'Twas her two sons that murder'd Bassianus ;
They cut thy sister's tongue and ravish'd her ,
And cut her hands and trimm'd her as thou saw'st .

O detestable villain , call'st thou that trimming ?

Why , she was wash'd , and cut , and trimm'd , and 'twas 
Trim sport for them that had the doing of it .

O barbarous , beastly villains , like thyself !

Indeed , I was their tutor to instruct them .
That codding spirit had they from their mother ,
As sure a card as ever won the set ;
That bloody mind , I think , they learn'd of me 
As true a dog as ever fought at head .
Well , let my deeds be witness of my worth .
I train'd thy brethren to that guileful hole 
Where the dead corpse of Bassianus lay ;
I wrote the letter that thy father found ,
And hid the gold within the letter mention'd ,
Confederate with the queen and her two sons :
And what not done , that thou hast cause to rue ,
Wherein I had no stroke of mischief in it ?
I play'd the cheater for thy father's hand ,
And , when I had it , drew myself apart ,
And almost broke my heart with extreme laughter .
I pry'd me through the crevice of a wall 
When , for his hand , he had his two sons' heads ;
Beheld his tears , and laugh'd so heartily ,
That both mine eyes were rainy like to his :
And when I told the empress of this sport ,
She swounded almost at my pleasing tale ,
And for my tidings gave me twenty kisses .

What , canst thou say all this , and never blush ?

Ay , like a black dog , as the saying is .

Art thou not sorry for these heinous deeds ?

Ay , that I had not done a thousand more .
Even now I curse the day , and yet , I think ,
Few come within the compass of my curse ,
Wherein I did not some notorious ill :
As kill a man , or else devise his death ;
Ravish a maid , or plot the way to do it ;
Accuse some innocent , and forswear myself ;
Set deadly enmity between two friends ;
Make poor men's cattle break their necks ;
Set fire on barns and hay-stacks in the night ,
And bid the owners quench them with their tears ,
Oft have I digg'd up dead men from their graves ,
And set them upright at their dear friends' doors ,
Even when their sorrows almost were forgot ;
And on their skins , as on the bark of trees ,
Have with my knife carved in Roman letters ,
'Let not your sorrow die , though I am dead .' 
Tut , I have done a thousand dreadful things 
As willingly as one would kill a fly ,
And nothing grieves me heartily indeed 
But that I cannot do ten thousand more .

Bring down the devil , for he must not die 
So sweet a death as hanging presently .

If there be devils , would I were a devil ,
To live and burn in everlasting fire ,
So I might have your company in hell ,
But to torment you with my bitter tongue !

Sirs , stop his mouth , and let him speak no more .


My lord , there is a messenger from Rome 
Desires to be admitted to your presence .

Let him come near .

Welcome ,  milius , what's the news from Rome ?

Lord Lucius , and you princes of the Goths ,
The Roman emperor greets you all by me ;
And , for he understands you are in arms ,
He craves a parley at your father's house ,
Willing you to demand your hostages ,
And they shall be immediately deliver'd .

What says our general ?

milius , let the emperor give his pledges 
Unto my father and my uncle Marcus ,
And we will come . March away .


Thus , in this strange and sad habiliment ,
I will encounter with Andronicus ,
And say I am Revenge , sent from below 
To join with him and right his heinous wrongs .
Knock at his study , where , they say , he keeps ,
To ruminate strange plots of dire revenge ;
Tell him , Revenge is come to join with him ,
And work confusion on his enemies .

Who doth molest my contemplation ?
Is it your trick to make me ope the door ,
That so my sad decrees may fly away ,
And all my study be to no effect ?
You are deceiv'd ; for what I mean to do ,
See here , in bloody lines I have set down ;
And what is written shall be executed .

Titus , I am come to talk with thee .

No , not a word ; how can I grace my talk ,
Wanting a hand to give it action ?
Thou hast the odds of me ; therefore no more .

If thou didst know me , thou wouldst talk with me .

I am not mad ; I know thee well enough :
Witness this wretched stump , witness these crimson lines ;
Witness these trenches made by grief and care ;
Witness the tiring day and heavy night ;
Witness all sorrow , that I know thee well 
For our proud empress , mighty Tamora .
Is not thy coming for my other hand ?

Know , thou sad man , I am not Tamora ;
She is thy enemy , and I thy friend :
I am Revenge , sent from the infernal kingdom ,
To ease the gnawing vulture of thy mind ,
By working wreakful vengeance on thy foes .
Come down , and welcome me to this world's light ;
Confer with me of murder and of death .
There's not a hollow cave or lurking-place ,
No vast obscurity or misty vale ,
Where bloody murder or detested rape 
Can couch for fear , but I will find them out ;
And in their ears tell them my dreadful name ,
Revenge , which makes the foul offender quake .

Art thou Revenge ? and art thou sent to me ,
To be a torment to mine enemies ?

I am ; therefore come down , and welcome me .

Do me some service ere I come to thee .
Lo , by thy side where Rape and Murder stands ;
Now give some surance that thou art Revenge :
Stab them , or tear them on thy chariot-wheels ,
And then I'll come and be thy waggoner ,
And whirl along with thee about the globe .
Provide two proper palfreys , black as jet ,
To hale thy vengeful waggon swift away ,
And find out murderers in their guilty caves :
And when thy car is loaden with their heads ,
I will dismount , and by the waggon-wheel 
Trot like a servile footman all day long ,
Even from Hyperion's rising in the east 
Until his very downfall in the sea :
And day by day I'll do this heavy task ,
So thou destroy Rapine and Murder there .

These are my ministers , and come with me .

Are these thy ministers ? what are they call'd ?

Rapine and Murder ; therefore called so ,
Cause they take vengeance of such kind of men .

Good Lord , how like the empress' sons they are ,
And you the empress , but we worldly men 
Have miserable , mad , mistaking eyes .
O sweet Revenge , now do I come to thee ;
And , if one arm's embracement will content thee ,
I will embrace thee in it by and by .


This closing with him fits his lunacy .
Whate'er I forge to feed his brain-sick fits ,
Do you uphold and maintain in your speeches ,
For now he firmly takes me for Revenge ;
And , being credulous in this mad thought ,
I'll make him send for Lucius his son ;
And , whilst I at a banquet hold him sure ,
I'll find some cunning practice out of hand 
To scatter and disperse the giddy Goths ,
Or , at the least , make them his enemies .
See , here he comes , and I must ply my theme .


Long have I been forlorn , and all for thee :
Welcome , dread Fury , to my woeful house :
Rapine and Murder , you are welcome too .
How like the empress and her sons you are !
Well are you fitted had you but a Moor :
Could not all hell afford you such a devil ?
For well I wot the empress never wags 
But in her company there is a Moor ;
And would you represent our queen aright ,
It were convenient you had such a devil .
But welcome as you are . What shall we do ?

What wouldst thou have us do , Andronicus ?

Show me a murderer , I'll deal with him .

Show me a villain that hath done a rape ,
And I am sent to be reveng'd on him .

Show me a thousand that have done thee wrong ,
And I will be revenged on them all .

Look round about the wicked streets of Rome ,
And when thou find'st a man that's like thyself ,
Good Murder , stab him ; he's a murderer .
Go thou with him ; and when it is thy hap 
To find another that is like to thee ,
Good Rapine , stab him ; he's a ravisher .
Go thou with them ; and in the emperor's court 
There is a queen attended by a Moor ;
Well mayst thou know her by thy own proportion ,
For up and down she doth resemble thee :
I pray thee , do on them some violent death ;
They have been violent to me and mine .

Well hast thou lesson'd us ; this shall we do .
But would it please thee , good Andronicus ,
To send for Lucius , thy thrice-valiant son ,
Who leads towards Rome a band of war-like Goths ,
And bid him come and banquet at thy house :
When he is here , even at thy solemn feast ,
I will bring in the empress and her sons ,
The emperor himself , and all thy foes ,
And at thy mercy shall they stoop and kneel ,
And on them shalt thou ease thy angry heart .
What says Andronicus to this device ?

Marcus , my brother , 'tis sad Titus calls .


Go , gentle Marcus , to thy nephew Lucius ;
Thou shalt inquire him out among the Goths :
Bid him repair to me , and bring with him 
Some of the chiefest princes of the Goths ;
Bid him encamp his soldiers where they are :
Tell him , the emperor and the empress too 
Feast at my house , and he shall feast with them .
This do thou for my love ; and so let him ,

As he regards his aged father's life .

This will I do , and soon return again .


Now will I hence about thy business ,
And take my ministers along with me .

Nay , nay , let Rape and Murder stay with me ;
Or else I'll call my brother back again ,
And cleave to no revenge but Lucius .

What say you , boys ? will you abide with him ,
Whiles I go tell my lord the emperor 
How I have govern'd our determin'd jest ?
Yield to his humour , smooth and speak him fair ,
And tarry with him till I turn again .

I know them all , though they suppose me mad ;
And will o'er-reach them in their own devices ;
A pair of cursed hell-hounds and their dam .

Madam , depart at pleasure ; leave us here .

Farewell , Andronicus : Revenge now goes 
To lay a complot to betray thy foes .


I know thou dost ; and , sweet Revenge , farewell .

Tell us , old man , how shall we be employ'd ?

Tut , I have work enough for you to do .
Publius , come hither , Caius , and Valentine !


What is your will ?

Know you these two ?

The empress' sons ,
I take them , Chiron and Demetrius .

Fie , Publius , fie , thou art too much deceiv'd ;
The one is Murder , Rape is the other's name ;
And therefore bind them , gentle Publius ;
Caius and Valentine , lay hands on them ;
Oft have you heard me wish for such an hour ,
And now I find it : therefore bind them sure ,
And stop their mouths , if they begin to cry .


Villains , forbear , we are the empress' sons .

And therefore do we what we are commanded .
Stop close their mouths , let them not speak a word .
Is he sure bound ? look that you bind them fast .


Come , come , Lavinia ; look , thy foes are bound .
Sirs , stop their mouths , let them not speak to me ,
But let them hear what fearful words I utter .
O villains , Chiron and Demetrius !
Here stands the spring whom you have stain'd with mud ,
This goodly summer with your winter mix'd .
You kill'd her husband , and for that vile fault 
Two of her brothers were condemn'd to death ,
My hand cut off and made a merry jest :
Both her sweet hands , her tongue , and that more dear 
Than hands or tongue , her spotless chastity ,
Inhuman traitors , you constrain'd and forc'd .
What would you say if I should let you speak ?
Villains , for shame you could not beg for grace .
Hark , wretches , how I mean to martyr you .
This one hand yet is left to cut your throats ,
Whilst that Levinia 'tween her stumps doth hold 
The basin that receives your guilty blood .
You know your mother means to feast with me ,
And calls herself Revenge , and thinks me mad .
Hark , villains , I will grind your bones to dust ,
And with your blood and it I'll make a paste ;
And of the paste a coffin I will rear ,
And make two pasties of your shameful heads ;
And bid that strumpet , your unhallow'd dam ,
Like to the earth swallow her own increase .
This is the feast that I have bid her to ,
And this the banquet she shall surfeit on ;
For worse than Philomel you us'd my daughter ,
And worse than Procne I will be reveng'd .
And now prepare your throats . Lavinia , come .

Receive the blood : and when that they are dead ,
Let me go grind their bones to powder small ,
And with this hateful liquor temper it ;
And in that paste let their vile heads be bak'd .
Come , come , be every one officious 
To make this banquet , which I wish may prove 
More stern and bloody than the Centaurs' feast .
So , now bring them in , for I will play the cook ,
And see them ready 'gainst their mother comes .


Uncle Marcus , since it is my father's mind 
That I repair to Rome , I am content .

And ours with thine , befall what fortune will .

Good uncle , take you in this barbarous Moor ,
This ravenous tiger , this accursed devil ;
Let him receive no sustenance , fetter him ,
Till he be brought unto the empress' face ,
For testimony of her foul proceedings :
And see the ambush of our friends be strong ;
I fear the emperor means no good to us .

Some devil whisper curses in mine ear ,
And prompt me , that my tongue may utter forth 
The venomous malice of my swelling heart !

Away , inhuman dog , unhallow'd slave !
Sirs , help our uncle to convey him in .

The trumpets show the emperor is at hand .


What , hath the firmament more suns than one ?

What boots it thee , to call thyself a sun ?

Rome's emperor , and nephew , break the parle ;
These quarrels must be quietly debated .
The feast is ready which the careful Titus 
Hath ordain'd to an honourable end ,
For peace , for love , for league , and good to Rome :
Please you , therefore , draw nigh , and take your places .

Marcus , we will .


Welcome , my gracious lord ; welcome , dread queen ;
Welcome , ye war-like Goths ; welcome , Lucius ;
And welcome , all . Although the cheer be poor ,
'Twill fill your stomachs ; please you eat of it .

Why art thou thus attir'd , Andronicus ?

Because I would be sure to have all well 
To entertain your highness , and your empress .

We are beholding to you , good Andronicus .

An if your highness knew my heart , you were .
My lord the emperor , resolve me this :
Was it well done of rash Virginius 
To slay his daughter with his own right hand ,
Because she was enforced , stain'd , and deflower'd ?

It was , Andronicus .

Your reason , mighty lord ?

Because the girl should not survive her shame ,
And by her presence still renew his sorrows .

A reason mighty , strong , and effectual ;
A pattern , precedent , and lively warrant ,
For me most wretched , to perform the like .
Die , die . Lavinia , and thy shame with thee ;
And with thy shame thy father's sorrow die !


What hast thou done , unnatural and unkind ?

Kill'd her , for whom my tears have made me blind .
I am as woeful as Virginius was ,
And have a thousand times more cause than he 
To do this outrage : and it is now done .

What , was she ravish'd ? tell who did the deed .

Will 't please you eat ? will 't please your highness feed ?

Why hast thou slain thine only daughter thus ?

Not I ; 'twas Chiron and Demetrius :
They ravish'd her , and cut away her tongue :
And they , 'twas they , that did her all this wrong .

Go fetch them hither to us presently .

Why , there they are both , baked in that pie ;
Whereof their mother daintily hath fed ,
Eating the flesh that she herself hath bred .
'Tis true , 'tis true ; witness my knife's sharp point .


Die , frantic wretch , for this accursed deed !


Can the son's eye behold his father bleed ?
There's meed for meed , death for a deadly deed !

You sad-fac'd men , people and sons of Rome ,
By uproar sever'd , like a flight of fowl 
Scatter'd by winds and high tempestuous gusts ,
O , let me teach you how to knit again 
This scatter'd corn into one mutual sheaf ,
These broken limbs again into one body ,
Lest Rome herself be bane unto herself ,
And she whom mighty kingdoms curtsy to ,
Like a forlorn and desperate castaway ,
Do shameful execution on herself .
But if my frosty signs and chaps of age ,
Grave witnesses of true experience ,
Cannot induce you to attend my words ,


Speak , Rome's dear friend , as erst our ancestor ,
When with his solemn tongue he did discourse 
To love-sick Dido's sad attending ear 
The story of that baleful burning night 
When subtle Greeks surpris'd King Priam's Troy ;
Tell us what Sinon hath bewitch'd our ears ,
Or who hath brought the fatal engine in 
That gives our Troy , our Rome , the civil wound .
My heart is not compact of flint nor steel ,
Nor can I utter all our bitter grief ,
But floods of tears will drown my oratory ,
And break my very utterance , even in the time 
When it should move you to attend me most ,
Lending your kind commiseration .
Here is a captain , let him tell the tale ;
Your hearts will throb and weep to hear him speak .

Then , noble auditory , be it known to you ,
That cursed Chiron and Demetrius 
Were they that murdered our emperor's brother ;
And they it was that ravished our sister .
For their fell faults our brothers were beheaded ,
Our father's tears despis'd , and basely cozen'd 
Of that true hand that fought Rome's quarrel out ,
And sent her enemies unto the grave :
Lastly , myself unkindly banished ,
The gates shut on me , and turn'd weeping out ,
To beg relief among Rome's enemies ;
Who drown'd their enmity in my true tears ,
And op'd their arms to embrace me as a friend :
And I am the turn'd forth , be it known to you ,
That have preserv'd her welfare in my blood ,
And from her bosom took the enemy's point ,
Sheathing the steel in my adventurous body .
Alas , you know I am no vaunter , I ;
My scars can witness , dumb although they are ,
That my report is just and full of truth .
But , soft , methinks I do digress too much ,
Citing my worthless praise : O , pardon me ;
For when no friends are by , men praise themselves .

Now is my turn to speak . Behold this child ;
Of this was Tamora delivered ,
The issue of an irreligious Moor ,
Chief architect and plotter of these woes .
The villain is alive in Titus' house ,
Damn'd as he is , to witness this is true .
Now judge what cause had Titus to revenge 
These wrongs , unspeakable , past patience ,
Or more than any living man could bear .
Now you have heard the truth , what say you Romans ?
Have we done aught amiss , show us wherein ,
And , from the place where you behold us now ,
The poor remainder of Andronici 
Will , hand in hand , all headlong cast us down ,
And on the ragged stones beat forth our brains ,
And make a mutual closure of our house .
Speak , Romans , speak , and if you say we shall ,
Lo , hand in hand , Lucius and I will fall .

Come , come , thou reverend man of Rome ,
And bring our emperor gently in thy hand ,
Lucius , our emperor ; for well I know 
The common voice do cry it shall be so .

Lucius , all hail , Rome's royal emperor !

Go , go into old Titus' sorrowful house ,
And hither , hale that misbelieving Moor ,
To be adjudg'd some direful slaughtering death ,
As punishment for his most wicked life .

Lucius , all hail , Rome's gracious governor !

Thanks , gentle Romans : may I govern so ,
To heal Rome's harms , and wipe away her woe !
But , gentle people , give me aim awhile ,
For nature puts me to a heavy task .
Stand all aloof ; but , uncle , draw you near ,
To shed obsequious tears upon this trunk .
O , take this warm kiss on thy pale cold lips ,

These sorrowful drops upon thy blood-stain'd face ,
The last true duties of thy noble son !

Tear for tear , and loving kiss for kiss ,
Thy brother Marcus tenders on thy lips :
O , were the sum of these that I should pay 
Countless and infinite , yet would I pay them .

Come hither , boy ; come , come , and learn of us 
To melt in showers : thy grandsire lov'd thee well :
Many a time he danc'd thee on his knee ,
Sung thee asleep , his loving breast thy pillow ;
Many a matter hath he told to thee ,
Meet and agreeing with thine infancy ;
In that respect , then , like a loving child ,
Shed yet some small drops from thy tender spring ,
Because kind nature doth require it so :
Friends should associate friends in grief and woe .
Bid him farewell ; commit him to the grave ;
Do him that kindness , and take leave of him .

O grandsire , grandsire , even with all my heart 
Would I were dead , so you did live again .
O Lord , I cannot speak to him for weeping ;
My tears will choke me if I ope my mouth .


You sad Andronici , have done with woes :
Give sentence on this execrable wretch ,
That hath been breeder of these dire events .

Set him breast-deep in earth , and famish him ;
There let him stand , and rave , and cry for food :
If any one relieves or pities him ,
For the offence he dies . This is our doom :
Some stay to see him fasten'd in the earth .

O , why should wrath be mute , and fury dumb ?
I am no baby , I , that with base prayers 
I should repent the evils I have done .
Ten thousand worse than ever yet I did 
Would I perform , if I might have my will :
If one good deed in all my life I did ,
I do repent it from my very soul .

Some loving friends convey the emperor hence ,
And give him burial in his father's grave .
My father and Lavinia shall forthwith 
Be closed in our household's monument .
As for that heinous tiger , Tamora ,
No funeral rite , nor man in mournful weeds ,
No mournful bell shall ring her burial ;
But throw her forth to beasts and birds of prey .
Her life was beast-like , and devoid of pity ;
And , being so , shall have like want of pity .
See justice done on Aaron , that damn'd Moor ,
By whom our heavy haps had their beginning :
Then , afterwards , to order well the state ,
That like events may ne'er it ruinate .
